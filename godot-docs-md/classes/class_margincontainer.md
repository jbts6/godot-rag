# MarginContainer

**Inherits:** `Container` **<** `Control` **<** `CanvasItem` **<** `Node` **<** `Object`

**Inherited By:** `EditorDock`

A container that keeps a margin around its child controls.

## Description

**MarginContainer** adds an adjustable margin on each side of its child controls. The margins are added around all children, not around each individual one. To control the **MarginContainer**'s margins, use the `margin_*` theme properties listed below.

**Note:** The margin sizes are theme overrides, not normal properties. This is an example of how to change them in code:

``` gdscript
# This code sample assumes the current script is extending MarginContainer.
var margin_value = 100
add_theme_constant_override("margin_top", margin_value)
add_theme_constant_override("margin_left", margin_value)
add_theme_constant_override("margin_bottom", margin_value)
add_theme_constant_override("margin_right", margin_value)
```

``` csharp
// This code sample assumes the current script is extending MarginContainer.
int marginValue = 100;
AddThemeConstantOverride("margin_top", marginValue);
AddThemeConstantOverride("margin_left", marginValue);
AddThemeConstantOverride("margin_bottom", marginValue);
AddThemeConstantOverride("margin_right", marginValue);
```
