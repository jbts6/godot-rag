# SkeletonModification2D

**Experimental:** This class may be changed or removed in future versions.

**Inherits:** `Resource` **<** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

**Inherited By:** `SkeletonModification2DCCDIK`, `SkeletonModification2DFABRIK`, `SkeletonModification2DJiggle`, `SkeletonModification2DLookAt`, `SkeletonModification2DPhysicalBones`, `SkeletonModification2DStackHolder`, `SkeletonModification2DTwoBoneIK`

Base class for resources that operate on `Bone2D`s in a `Skeleton2D`.

## Description

This resource provides an interface that can be expanded so code that operates on `Bone2D` nodes in a `Skeleton2D` can be mixed and matched together to create complex interactions.

This is used to provide Godot with a flexible and powerful Inverse Kinematics solution that can be adapted for many different uses.

## Property Descriptions

`bool` **enabled** = `true`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_enabled**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **get_enabled**()

If `true`, the modification's `_execute()` function will be called by the `SkeletonModificationStack2D`.

`int` **execution_mode** = `0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_execution_mode**(value: `int`)
- `int` **get_execution_mode**()

The execution mode for the modification. This tells the modification stack when to execute the modification. Some modifications have settings that are only available in certain execution modes.

## Method Descriptions

`void (No return value.)` **\_draw_editor_gizmo**() `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`

Used for drawing **editor-only** modification gizmos. This function will only be called in the Godot editor and can be overridden to draw custom gizmos.

**Note:** You will need to use the Skeleton2D from `SkeletonModificationStack2D.get_skeleton()` and it's draw functions, as the **SkeletonModification2D** resource cannot draw on its own.

`void (No return value.)` **\_execute**(delta: `float`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`

Executes the given modification. This is where the modification performs whatever function it is designed to do.

`void (No return value.)` **\_setup_modification**(modification_stack: `SkeletonModificationStack2D`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`

Called when the modification is setup. This is where the modification performs initialization.

`float` **clamp_angle**(angle: `float`, min: `float`, max: `float`, invert: `bool`)

Takes an angle and clamps it so it is within the passed-in `min` and `max` range. `invert` will inversely clamp the angle, clamping it to the range outside of the given bounds.

`bool` **get_editor_draw_gizmo**() `const`

Returns whether this modification will call `_draw_editor_gizmo()` in the Godot editor to draw modification-specific gizmos.

`bool` **get_is_setup**() `const`

Returns whether this modification has been successfully setup or not.

`SkeletonModificationStack2D` **get_modification_stack**()

Returns the `SkeletonModificationStack2D` that this modification is bound to. Through the modification stack, you can access the Skeleton2D the modification is operating on.

`void (No return value.)` **set_editor_draw_gizmo**(draw_gizmo: `bool`)

Sets whether this modification will call `_draw_editor_gizmo()` in the Godot editor to draw modification-specific gizmos.

`void (No return value.)` **set_is_setup**(is_setup: `bool`)

Manually allows you to set the setup state of the modification. This function should only rarely be used, as the `SkeletonModificationStack2D` the modification is bound to should handle setting the modification up.
