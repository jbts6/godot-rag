# OpenXRFutureExtension

**Inherits:** `OpenXRExtensionWrapper` **<** `Object`

The OpenXR Future extension allows for asynchronous APIs to be used.

## Description

This is a support extension in OpenXR that allows other OpenXR extensions to start asynchronous functions and get a callback after this function finishes. It is not intended for consumption within GDScript but can be accessed from GDExtension.

## Method Descriptions

`void (No return value.)` **cancel_future**(future: `int`)

Cancels an in-progress future. `future` must be an `XrFutureEXT` value previously returned by an API that started an asynchronous function.

`bool` **is_active**() `const`

Returns `true` if futures are available in the OpenXR runtime used. This function will only return a usable result after OpenXR has been initialized.

`OpenXRFutureResult` **register_future**(future: `int`, on_success: `Callable` = Callable())

Register an OpenXR Future object so we monitor for completion. `future` must be an `XrFutureEXT` value previously returned by an API that started an asynchronous function.

You can optionally specify `on_success`, it will be invoked on successful completion of the future.

Or you can use the returned `OpenXRFutureResult` object to `await` its `OpenXRFutureResult.completed` signal.

    var future_result = OpenXRFutureExtension.register_future(future)
    await future_result.completed
    if future_result.get_status() == OpenXRFutureResult.RESULT_FINISHED:
        # Handle your success
        pass
