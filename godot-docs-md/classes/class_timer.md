# Timer

**Inherits:** `Node` **<** `Object`

A countdown timer.

## Description

The **Timer** node is a countdown timer and is the simplest way to handle time-based logic in the engine. When a timer reaches the end of its `wait_time`, it will emit the `timeout` signal.

After a timer enters the scene tree, it can be manually started with `start()`. A timer node is also started automatically if `autostart` is `true`.

Without requiring much code, a timer node can be added and configured in the editor. The `timeout` signal it emits can also be connected through the Signals dock in the editor:

    func _on_timer_timeout():
        print("Time to attack!")

**Note:** To create a one-shot timer without instantiating a node, use `SceneTree.create_timer()`.

**Note:** Timers are affected by `Engine.time_scale` unless `ignore_time_scale` is `true`. The higher the time scale, the sooner timers will end. How often a timer processes may depend on the framerate or `Engine.physics_ticks_per_second`.

## Signals

**timeout**()

Emitted when the timer reaches the end.

## Enumerations

enum **TimerProcessCallback**:

`TimerProcessCallback` **TIMER_PROCESS_PHYSICS** = `0`

Update the timer every physics process frame (see `Node.NOTIFICATION_INTERNAL_PHYSICS_PROCESS`).

`TimerProcessCallback` **TIMER_PROCESS_IDLE** = `1`

Update the timer every process (rendered) frame (see `Node.NOTIFICATION_INTERNAL_PROCESS`).

## Property Descriptions

`bool` **autostart** = `false`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_autostart**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **has_autostart**()

If `true`, the timer will start immediately when it enters the scene tree.

**Note:** After the timer enters the tree, this property is automatically set to `false`.

**Note:** This property does nothing when the timer is running in the editor.

`bool` **ignore_time_scale** = `false`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_ignore_time_scale**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **is_ignoring_time_scale**()

If `true`, the timer will ignore `Engine.time_scale` and update with the real, elapsed time.

`bool` **one_shot** = `false`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_one_shot**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **is_one_shot**()

If `true`, the timer will stop after reaching the end. Otherwise, as by default, the timer will automatically restart.

`bool` **paused**

- `void (No return value.)` **set_paused**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **is_paused**()

If `true`, the timer is paused. A paused timer does not process until this property is set back to `false`, even when `start()` is called. See also `stop()`.

`TimerProcessCallback` **process_callback** = `1`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_timer_process_callback**(value: `TimerProcessCallback`)
- `TimerProcessCallback` **get_timer_process_callback**()

Specifies when the timer is updated during the main loop.

`float` **time_left**

- `float` **get_time_left**()

The timer's remaining time in seconds. This is always `0` if the timer is stopped.

**Note:** This property is read-only and cannot be modified. It is based on `wait_time`.

`float` **wait_time** = `1.0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_wait_time**(value: `float`)
- `float` **get_wait_time**()

The time required for the timer to end, in seconds. This property can also be set every time `start()` is called.

**Note:** Timers can only process once per physics or process frame (depending on the `process_callback`). An unstable framerate may cause the timer to end inconsistently, which is especially noticeable if the wait time is lower than roughly `0.05` seconds. For very short timers, it is recommended to write your own code instead of using a **Timer** node. Timers are also affected by `Engine.time_scale`.

## Method Descriptions

`bool` **is_stopped**() `const`

Returns `true` if the timer is stopped or has not started.

`void (No return value.)` **start**(time_sec: `float` = -1)

Starts the timer, or resets the timer if it was started already. Fails if the timer is not inside the scene tree. If `time_sec` is greater than `0`, this value is used for the `wait_time`.

**Note:** This method does not resume a paused timer. See `paused`.

`void (No return value.)` **stop**()

Stops the timer. See also `paused`. Unlike `start()`, this can safely be called if the timer is not inside the scene tree.

**Note:** Calling `stop()` does not emit the `timeout` signal, as the timer is not considered to have timed out. If this is desired, use `$Timer.timeout.emit()` after calling `stop()` to manually emit the signal.
