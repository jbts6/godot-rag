# Texture3D

**Inherits:** `Texture` **<** `Resource` **<** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

**Inherited By:** `CompressedTexture3D`, `ImageTexture3D`, `NoiseTexture3D`, `PlaceholderTexture3D`, `Texture3DRD`

Base class for 3-dimensional textures.

## Description

Base class for `ImageTexture3D` and `CompressedTexture3D`. Cannot be used directly, but contains all the functions necessary for accessing the derived resource types. **Texture3D** is the base class for all 3-dimensional texture types. See also `TextureLayered`.

All images need to have the same width, height and number of mipmap levels.

To create such a texture file yourself, reimport your image files using the Godot Editor import presets.

## Method Descriptions

`Array`\[`Image`\] **\_get_data**() `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `required (This method is required to be overridden when extending its base class.)` `const`

Called when the **Texture3D**'s data is queried.

`int` **\_get_depth**() `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `required (This method is required to be overridden when extending its base class.)` `const`

Called when the **Texture3D**'s depth is queried.

`Format` **\_get_format**() `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `required (This method is required to be overridden when extending its base class.)` `const`

Called when the **Texture3D**'s format is queried.

`int` **\_get_height**() `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `required (This method is required to be overridden when extending its base class.)` `const`

Called when the **Texture3D**'s height is queried.

`int` **\_get_width**() `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `required (This method is required to be overridden when extending its base class.)` `const`

Called when the **Texture3D**'s width is queried.

`bool` **\_has_mipmaps**() `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `required (This method is required to be overridden when extending its base class.)` `const`

Called when the presence of mipmaps in the **Texture3D** is queried.

`Resource` **create_placeholder**() `const`

Creates a placeholder version of this resource (`PlaceholderTexture3D`).

`Array`\[`Image`\] **get_data**() `const`

Returns the **Texture3D**'s data as an array of `Image`s. Each `Image` represents a *slice* of the **Texture3D**, with different slices mapping to different depth (Z axis) levels.

`int` **get_depth**() `const`

Returns the **Texture3D**'s depth in pixels. Depth is typically represented by the Z axis (a dimension not present in `Texture2D`).

`Format` **get_format**() `const`

Returns the current format being used by this texture.

`int` **get_height**() `const`

Returns the **Texture3D**'s height in pixels. Width is typically represented by the Y axis.

`int` **get_width**() `const`

Returns the **Texture3D**'s width in pixels. Width is typically represented by the X axis.

`bool` **has_mipmaps**() `const`

Returns `true` if the **Texture3D** has generated mipmaps.
