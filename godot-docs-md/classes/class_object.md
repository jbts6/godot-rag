Base class for all other classes in the engine.

## Description

An advanced `Variant` type. All classes in the engine inherit from Object. Each class may define new properties, methods or signals, which are available to all inheriting classes. For example, a `Sprite2D` instance is able to call `Node.add_child()` because it inherits from `Node`.

You can create new instances, using `Object.new()` in GDScript, or `new GodotObject` in C#.

To delete an Object instance, call `free()`. This is necessary for most classes inheriting Object, because they do not manage memory on their own, and will otherwise cause memory leaks when no longer in use. There are a few classes that perform memory management. For example, `RefCounted` (and by extension `Resource`) deletes itself when no longer referenced, and `Node` deletes its children when freed.

Objects can have a `Script` attached to them. Once the `Script` is instantiated, it effectively acts as an extension to the base class, allowing it to define and inherit new properties, methods and signals.

Inside a `Script`, `_get_property_list()` may be overridden to customize properties in several ways. This allows them to be available to the editor, display as lists of options, sub-divide into groups, save on disk, etc. Scripting languages offer easier ways to customize properties, such as with the `@GDScript.@export` annotation.

Godot is very dynamic. An object's script, and therefore its properties, methods and signals, can be changed at run-time. Because of this, there can be occasions where, for example, a property required by a method may not exist. To prevent run-time errors, see methods such as `set()`, `get()`, `call()`, `has_method()`, `has_signal()`, etc. Note that these methods are **much** slower than direct references.

In GDScript, you can also check if a given property, method, or signal name exists in an object with the `in` operator:

    var node = Node.new()
    print("name" in node)         # Prints true
    print("get_parent" in node)   # Prints true
    print("tree_entered" in node) # Prints true
    print("unknown" in node)      # Prints false

Notifications are `int` constants commonly sent and received by objects. For example, on every rendered frame, the `SceneTree` notifies nodes inside the tree with a `Node.NOTIFICATION_PROCESS`. The nodes receive it and may call `Node._process()` to update. To make use of notifications, see `notification()` and `_notification()`.

Lastly, every object can also contain metadata (data about data). `set_meta()` can be useful to store information that the object itself does not depend on. To keep your code clean, making excessive use of metadata is discouraged.

**Note:** Unlike references to a `RefCounted`, references to an object stored in a variable can become invalid without being set to `null`. To check if an object has been deleted, do *not* compare it against `null`. Instead, use `@GlobalScope.is_instance_valid()`. It's also recommended to inherit from `RefCounted` for classes storing data instead of **Object**.

**Note:** The `script` is not exposed like most properties. To set or get an object's `Script` in code, use `set_script()` and `get_script()`, respectively.

**Note:** In a boolean context, an **Object** will evaluate to `false` if it is equal to `null` or it has been freed. Otherwise, an **Object** will always evaluate to `true`. See also `@GlobalScope.is_instance_valid()`.

- `When and how to avoid using nodes for everything `
- `Object notifications `

## Signals

**property_list_changed**()

Emitted when `notify_property_list_changed()` is called.

**script_changed**()

Emitted when the object's script is changed.

**Note:** When this signal is emitted, the new script is not initialized yet. If you need to access the new script, defer connections to this signal with `CONNECT_DEFERRED`.

## Enumerations

flags **ConnectFlags**:

`ConnectFlags` **CONNECT_DEFERRED** = `1`

Deferred connections trigger their `Callable`s on idle time (at the end of the frame), rather than instantly.

`ConnectFlags` **CONNECT_PERSIST** = `2`

Persisting connections are stored when the object is serialized (such as when using `PackedScene.pack()`). In the editor, connections created through the Signals dock are always persisting.

**Note:** Connections to lambda functions (that is, when the function code is embedded in the `connect()` call) cannot be made persistent.

`ConnectFlags` **CONNECT_ONE_SHOT** = `4`

One-shot connections disconnect themselves after emission.

`ConnectFlags` **CONNECT_REFERENCE_COUNTED** = `8`

Reference-counted connections can be assigned to the same `Callable` multiple times. Each disconnection decreases the internal counter. The signal fully disconnects only when the counter reaches 0.

`ConnectFlags` **CONNECT_APPEND_SOURCE_OBJECT** = `16`

On signal emission, the source object is automatically appended after the original arguments of the signal, regardless of the connected `Callable`'s unbinds which affect only the original arguments of the signal (see `Callable.unbind()`, `Callable.get_unbound_arguments_count()`).

    extends Object

    signal test_signal

    func test():
        print(self) # Prints e.g. <Object#35332818393>
        test_signal.connect(prints.unbind(1), CONNECT_APPEND_SOURCE_OBJECT)
        test_signal.emit("emit_arg_1", "emit_arg_2") # Prints emit_arg_1 <Object#35332818393>

## Constants

**NOTIFICATION_POSTINITIALIZE** = `0`

Notification received when the object is initialized, before its script is attached. Used internally.

**NOTIFICATION_PREDELETE** = `1`

Notification received when the object is about to be deleted. Can be used like destructors in object-oriented programming languages.

This notification is sent in reversed order.

**NOTIFICATION_EXTENSION_RELOADED** = `2`

Notification received when the object finishes hot reloading. This notification is only sent for extensions classes and derived.

## Method Descriptions

`Variant` **\_get**(property: `StringName`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`

Override this method to customize the behavior of `get()`. Should return the given `property`'s value, or `null` if the `property` should be handled normally.

Combined with `_set()` and `_get_property_list()`, this method allows defining custom properties, which is particularly useful for editor plugins.

**Note:** This method is not called when getting built-in properties of an object, including properties defined with `@GDScript.@export`.

``` gdscript
func _get(property):
    if property == "fake_property":
        print("Getting my property!")
        return 4
    return null

func _get_property_list():
    return [
        { "name": "fake_property", "type": TYPE_INT }
    ]
```

``` csharp
public override Variant _Get(StringName property)
{
    if (property == "FakeProperty")
    {
        GD.Print("Getting my property!");
        return 4;
    }
    return default;
}

public override Godot.Collections.Array<Godot.Collections.Dictionary> _GetPropertyList()
{
    return
    [
        new Godot.Collections.Dictionary()
        {
            { "name", "FakeProperty" },
            { "type", (int)Variant.Type.Int },
        },
    ];
}
```

**Note:** Unlike other virtual methods, this method is called automatically for every script that overrides it. This means that the base implementation should not be called via `super` in GDScript or its equivalents in other languages. The bottom-most sub-class will be called first, with subsequent calls ascending the class hierarchy. The call chain will stop on the first class that returns a non-`null` value.

**Warning:** This method must be `thread-safe ` if overridden. Otherwise, the engine may crash when trying to save a resource containing the object.

`Array`\[`Dictionary`\] **\_get_property_list**() `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`

Override this method to provide a custom list of additional properties to handle by the engine.

Should return a property list, as an `Array` of dictionaries. The result is added to the array of `get_property_list()`, and should be formatted in the same way. Each `Dictionary` must at least contain the `name` and `type` entries.

You can use `_property_can_revert()` and `_property_get_revert()` to customize the default values of the properties added by this method.

The example below displays a list of numbers shown as words going from `ZERO` to `FIVE`, with `number_count` controlling the size of the list:

``` gdscript
@tool
extends Node

@export var number_count = 3:
    set(nc):
        number_count = nc
        numbers.resize(number_count)
        notify_property_list_changed()

var numbers = PackedInt32Array([0, 0, 0])

func _get_property_list():
    var properties: Array[Dictionary] = []

    for i in range(number_count):
        properties.append({
            "name": "number_%d" % i,
            "type": TYPE_INT,
            "hint": PROPERTY_HINT_ENUM,
            "hint_string": "ZERO,ONE,TWO,THREE,FOUR,FIVE",
        })

    return properties

func _get(property):
    if property.begins_with("number_"):
        var index = property.get_slice("_", 1).to_int()
        return numbers[index]
    return null

func _set(property, value):
    if property.begins_with("number_"):
        var index = property.get_slice("_", 1).to_int()
        numbers[index] = value
        return true
    return false
```

``` csharp
[Tool]
public partial class MyNode : Node
{
    private int _numberCount;

    [Export]
    public int NumberCount
    {
        get => _numberCount;
        set
        {
            _numberCount = value;
            _numbers.Resize(_numberCount);
            NotifyPropertyListChanged();
        }
    }

    private Godot.Collections.Array<int> _numbers = [];

    public override Godot.Collections.Array<Godot.Collections.Dictionary> _GetPropertyList()
    {
        Godot.Collections.Array<Godot.Collections.Dictionary> properties = [];

        for (int i = 0; i < _numberCount; i++)
        {
            properties.Add(new Godot.Collections.Dictionary()
            {
                { "name", $"number_{i}" },
                { "type", (int)Variant.Type.Int },
                { "hint", (int)PropertyHint.Enum },
                { "hint_string", "Zero,One,Two,Three,Four,Five" },
            });
        }

        return properties;
    }

    public override Variant _Get(StringName property)
    {
        string propertyName = property.ToString();
        if (propertyName.StartsWith("number_"))
        {
            int index = int.Parse(propertyName.Substring("number_".Length));
            return _numbers[index];
        }
        return default;
    }

    public override bool _Set(StringName property, Variant value)
    {
        string propertyName = property.ToString();
        if (propertyName.StartsWith("number_"))
        {
            int index = int.Parse(propertyName.Substring("number_".Length));
            _numbers[index] = value.As<int>();
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

**Note:** This method is intended for advanced purposes. For most common use cases, the scripting languages offer easier ways to handle properties. See `@GDScript.@export`, `@GDScript.@export_enum`, `@GDScript.@export_group`, etc. If you want to customize exported properties, use `_validate_property()`.

**Note:** If the object's script is not `@GDScript.@tool`, this method will not be called in the editor.

**Note:** Unlike other virtual methods, this method is called automatically for every script that overrides it. This means that the base implementation should not be called via `super` in GDScript or its equivalents in other languages. The bottom-most sub-class will be called first, with subsequent calls ascending the class hierarchy.

**Warning:** This method must be `thread-safe ` if overridden. Otherwise, the engine may crash when trying to save a resource containing the object.

`void (No return value.)` **\_init**() `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`

Called when the object's script is instantiated, oftentimes after the object is initialized in memory (through `Object.new()` in GDScript, or `new GodotObject` in C#). It can be also defined to take in parameters. This method is similar to a constructor in most programming languages.

**Note:** If `_init()` is defined with *required* parameters, the Object with script may only be created directly. If any other means (such as `PackedScene.instantiate()` or `Node.duplicate()`) are used, the script's initialization will fail.

`Variant` **\_iter_get**(iter: `Variant`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`

Returns the current iterable value. `iter` stores the iteration state, but unlike `_iter_init()` and `_iter_next()` the state is supposed to be read-only, so there is no `Array` wrapper.

**Tip:** In GDScript, you can use a subtype of `Variant` as the return type for `_iter_get()`. The specified type will be used to set the type of the iterator variable in `for` loops, enhancing type safety.

`bool` **\_iter_init**(iter: `Array`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`

Initializes the iterator. `iter` stores the iteration state. Since GDScript does not support passing arguments by reference, a single-element array is used as a wrapper. Returns `true` so long as the iterator has not reached the end.

    class MyRange:
        var _from
        var _to

        func _init(from, to):
            assert(from <= to)
            _from = from
            _to = to

        func _iter_init(iter):
            iter[0] = _from
            return iter[0] < _to

        func _iter_next(iter):
            iter[0] += 1
            return iter[0] < _to

        func _iter_get(iter):
            return iter

    func _ready():
        var my_range = MyRange.new(2, 5)
        for x in my_range:
            print(x) # Prints 2, 3, 4.

**Note:** Avoid storing iterator state in a member variable, use the `iter` parameter instead. Otherwise, you won't be able to reuse the same iterator instance in nested loops.

See also [online docs](../tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_advanced.html#custom-iterators).

`bool` **\_iter_next**(iter: `Array`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`

Moves the iterator to the next iteration. `iter` stores the iteration state. Since GDScript does not support passing arguments by reference, a single-element array is used as a wrapper. Returns `true` so long as the iterator has not reached the end.

`void (No return value.)` **\_notification**(what: `int`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`

Called when the object receives a notification, which can be identified in `what` by comparing it with a constant. See also `notification()`.

``` gdscript
func _notification(what):
    if what == NOTIFICATION_PREDELETE:
        print("Goodbye!")
```

``` csharp
public override void _Notification(int what)
{
    if (what == NotificationPredelete)
    {
        GD.Print("Goodbye!");
    }
}
```

**Note:** The base **Object** defines a few notifications (`NOTIFICATION_POSTINITIALIZE` and `NOTIFICATION_PREDELETE`). Inheriting classes such as `Node` define a lot more notifications, which are also received by this method.

**Note:** Unlike other virtual methods, this method is called automatically for every script that overrides it. This means that the base implementation should not be called via `super` in GDScript or its equivalents in other languages. Call order depends on the `reversed` argument of `notification()` and varies between different notifications. Most notifications are sent in the forward order (i.e. Object class first, most derived class last).

`bool` **\_property_can_revert**(property: `StringName`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`

Override this method to customize the given `property`'s revert behavior. Should return `true` if the `property` has a custom default value and is revertible in the Inspector dock. Use `_property_get_revert()` to specify the `property`'s default value.

**Note:** This method must return consistently, regardless of the current value of the `property`.

**Note:** Unlike other virtual methods, this method is called automatically for every script that overrides it. This means that the base implementation should not be called via `super` in GDScript or its equivalents in other languages. The bottom-most sub-class will be called first, with subsequent calls ascending the class hierarchy. The call chain will stop on the first class that returns `true`.

`Variant` **\_property_get_revert**(property: `StringName`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`

Override this method to customize the given `property`'s revert behavior. Should return the default value for the `property`. If the default value differs from the `property`'s current value, a revert icon is displayed in the Inspector dock.

**Note:** `_property_can_revert()` must also be overridden for this method to be called.

**Note:** Unlike other virtual methods, this method is called automatically for every script that overrides it. This means that the base implementation should not be called via `super` in GDScript or its equivalents in other languages. The bottom-most sub-class will be called first, with subsequent calls ascending the class hierarchy. The call chain will stop on the first class that returns a non-`null` value.

`bool` **\_set**(property: `StringName`, value: `Variant`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`

Override this method to customize the behavior of `set()`. Should set the `property` to `value` and return `true`, or `false` if the `property` should be handled normally. The *exact* way to set the `property` is up to this method's implementation.

Combined with `_get()` and `_get_property_list()`, this method allows defining custom properties, which is particularly useful for editor plugins.

**Note:** This method is not called when setting built-in properties of an object, including properties defined with `@GDScript.@export`.

``` gdscript
var internal_data = {}

func _set(property, value):
    if property == "fake_property":
        # Storing the value in the fake property.
        internal_data["fake_property"] = value
        return true
    return false

func _get_property_list():
    return [
        { "name": "fake_property", "type": TYPE_INT }
    ]
```

``` csharp
private Godot.Collections.Dictionary _internalData = new Godot.Collections.Dictionary();

public override bool _Set(StringName property, Variant value)
{
    if (property == "FakeProperty")
    {
        // Storing the value in the fake property.
        _internalData["FakeProperty"] = value;
        return true;
    }

    return false;
}

public override Godot.Collections.Array<Godot.Collections.Dictionary> _GetPropertyList()
{
    return
    [
        new Godot.Collections.Dictionary()
        {
            { "name", "FakeProperty" },
            { "type", (int)Variant.Type.Int },
        },
    ];
}
```

**Note:** Unlike other virtual methods, this method is called automatically for every script that overrides it. This means that the base implementation should not be called via `super` in GDScript or its equivalents in other languages. The bottom-most sub-class will be called first, with subsequent calls ascending the class hierarchy. The call chain will stop on the first class that returns `true`.

`String` **\_to_string**() `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`

Override this method to customize the return value of `to_string()`, and therefore the object's representation as a `String`.

    func _to_string():
        return "Welcome to Godot 4!"

    func _init():
        print(self)       # Prints "Welcome to Godot 4!"
        var a = str(self) # a is "Welcome to Godot 4!"

`void (No return value.)` **\_validate_property**(property: `Dictionary`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`

Override this method to customize existing properties. Every property info goes through this method, except properties added with `_get_property_list()`. The dictionary contents is the same as in `_get_property_list()`.

``` gdscript
@tool
extends Node

@export var is_number_editable: bool:
    set(value):
        is_number_editable = value
        notify_property_list_changed()
@export var number: int

func _validate_property(property: Dictionary):
    if property.name == "number" and not is_number_editable:
        property.usage |= PROPERTY_USAGE_READ_ONLY
```

``` csharp
[Tool]
public partial class MyNode : Node
{
    private bool _isNumberEditable;

    [Export]
    public bool IsNumberEditable
    {
        get => _isNumberEditable;
        set
        {
            _isNumberEditable = value;
            NotifyPropertyListChanged();
        }
    }

    [Export]
    public int Number { get; set; }

    public override void _ValidateProperty(Godot.Collections.Dictionary property)
    {
        if (property["name"].AsStringName() == PropertyName.Number && !IsNumberEditable)
        {
            var usage = property["usage"].As<PropertyUsageFlags>() | PropertyUsageFlags.ReadOnly;
            property["usage"] = (int)usage;
        }
    }
}
```

`void (No return value.)` **add_user_signal**(signal: `String`, arguments: `Array` = \[\])

Adds a user-defined signal named `signal`. Optional arguments for the signal can be added as an `Array` of dictionaries, each defining a `name` `String` and a `type` `int` (see `Variant.Type`). See also `has_user_signal()` and `remove_user_signal()`.

``` gdscript
add_user_signal("hurt", [
    { "name": "damage", "type": TYPE_INT },
    { "name": "source", "type": TYPE_OBJECT }
])
```

``` csharp
AddUserSignal("Hurt",
[
    new Godot.Collections.Dictionary()
    {
        { "name", "damage" },
        { "type", (int)Variant.Type.Int },
    },
    new Godot.Collections.Dictionary()
    {
        { "name", "source" },
        { "type", (int)Variant.Type.Object },
    },
]);
```

`Variant` **call**(method: `StringName`, ...) `vararg`

Calls the `method` on the object and returns the result. This method supports a variable number of arguments, so parameters can be passed as a comma separated list.

``` gdscript
var node = Node3D.new()
node.call("rotate", Vector3(1.0, 0.0, 0.0), 1.571)
```

``` csharp
var node = new Node3D();
node.Call(Node3D.MethodName.Rotate, new Vector3(1f, 0f, 0f), 1.571f);
```

**Note:** In C#, `method` must be in snake_case when referring to built-in Godot methods. Prefer using the names exposed in the `MethodName` class to avoid allocating a new `StringName` on each call.

`Variant` **call_deferred**(method: `StringName`, ...) `vararg`

Calls the `method` on the object during idle time. Always returns `null`, **not** the method's result.

Idle time happens mainly at the end of process and physics frames. In it, deferred calls will be run until there are none left, which means you can defer calls from other deferred calls and they'll still be run in the current idle time cycle. This means you should not call a method deferred from itself (or from a method called by it), as this causes infinite recursion the same way as if you had called the method directly.

This method supports a variable number of arguments, so parameters can be passed as a comma separated list.

``` gdscript
var node = Node3D.new()
node.call_deferred("rotate", Vector3(1.0, 0.0, 0.0), 1.571)
```

``` csharp
var node = new Node3D();
node.CallDeferred(Node3D.MethodName.Rotate, new Vector3(1f, 0f, 0f), 1.571f);
```

For methods that are deferred from the same thread, the order of execution at idle time is identical to the order in which `call_deferred` was called.

See also `Callable.call_deferred()`.

**Note:** In C#, `method` must be in snake_case when referring to built-in Godot methods. Prefer using the names exposed in the `MethodName` class to avoid allocating a new `StringName` on each call.

**Note:** If you're looking to delay the function call by a frame, refer to the `SceneTree.process_frame` and `SceneTree.physics_frame` signals.

    var node = Node3D.new()
    # Make a Callable and bind the arguments to the node's rotate() call.
    var callable = node.rotate.bind(Vector3(1.0, 0.0, 0.0), 1.571)
    # Connect the callable to the process_frame signal, so it gets called in the next process frame.
    # CONNECT_ONE_SHOT makes sure it only gets called once instead of every frame.
    get_tree().process_frame.connect(callable, CONNECT_ONE_SHOT)

`Variant` **callv**(method: `StringName`, arg_array: `Array`)

Calls the `method` on the object and returns the result. Unlike `call()`, this method expects all parameters to be contained inside `arg_array`.

``` gdscript
var node = Node3D.new()
node.callv("rotate", [Vector3(1.0, 0.0, 0.0), 1.571])
```

``` csharp
var node = new Node3D();
node.Callv(Node3D.MethodName.Rotate, [new Vector3(1f, 0f, 0f), 1.571f]);
```

**Note:** In C#, `method` must be in snake_case when referring to built-in Godot methods. Prefer using the names exposed in the `MethodName` class to avoid allocating a new `StringName` on each call.

`bool` **can_translate_messages**() `const`

Returns `true` if the object is allowed to translate messages with `tr()` and `tr_n()`. See also `set_message_translation()`.

`void (No return value.)` **cancel_free**()

If this method is called during `NOTIFICATION_PREDELETE`, this object will reject being freed and will remain allocated. This is mostly an internal function used for error handling to avoid the user from freeing objects when they are not intended to.

`Error` **connect**(signal: `StringName`, callable: `Callable`, flags: `int` = 0)

Connects a `signal` by name to a `callable`. Optional `flags` can be also added to configure the connection's behavior (see `ConnectFlags` constants).

A signal can only be connected once to the same `Callable`. If the signal is already connected, this method returns `@GlobalScope.ERR_INVALID_PARAMETER` and generates an error, unless the signal is connected with `CONNECT_REFERENCE_COUNTED`. To prevent this, use `is_connected()` first to check for existing connections.

**Note:** If the `callable`'s object is freed, the connection will be lost.

**Note:** In GDScript, it is generally recommended to connect signals with `Signal.connect()` instead.

**Note:** This method, and all other signal-related methods, are thread-safe.

`void (No return value.)` **disconnect**(signal: `StringName`, callable: `Callable`)

Disconnects a `signal` by name from a given `callable`. If the connection does not exist, generates an error. Use `is_connected()` to make sure that the connection exists.

`Error` **emit_signal**(signal: `StringName`, ...) `vararg`

Emits the given `signal` by name. The signal must exist, so it should be a built-in signal of this class or one of its inherited classes, or a user-defined signal (see `add_user_signal()`). This method supports a variable number of arguments, so parameters can be passed as a comma separated list.

Returns `@GlobalScope.ERR_UNAVAILABLE` if `signal` does not exist or the parameters are invalid.

``` gdscript
emit_signal("hit", "sword", 100)
emit_signal("game_over")
```

``` csharp
EmitSignal(SignalName.Hit, "sword", 100);
EmitSignal(SignalName.GameOver);
```

**Note:** In C#, `signal` must be in snake_case when referring to built-in Godot signals. Prefer using the names exposed in the `SignalName` class to avoid allocating a new `StringName` on each call.

`void (No return value.)` **free**()

Deletes the object from memory. Pre-existing references to the object become invalid, and any attempt to access them will result in a runtime error. Checking the references with `@GlobalScope.is_instance_valid()` will return `false`. This is equivalent to the `memdelete` function in GDExtension C++.

`Variant` **get**(property: `StringName`) `const`

Returns the `Variant` value of the given `property`. If the `property` does not exist, this method returns `null`.

``` gdscript
var node = Node2D.new()
node.rotation = 1.5
var a = node.get("rotation") # a is 1.5
```

``` csharp
var node = new Node2D();
node.Rotation = 1.5f;
var a = node.Get(Node2D.PropertyName.Rotation); // a is 1.5
```

**Note:** In C#, `property` must be in snake_case when referring to built-in Godot properties. Prefer using the names exposed in the `PropertyName` class to avoid allocating a new `StringName` on each call.

`String` **get_class**() `const`

Returns the object's built-in class name, as a `String`. See also `is_class()`.

**Note:** This method ignores `class_name` declarations. If this object's script has defined a `class_name`, the base, built-in class name is returned instead.

`Array`\[`Dictionary`\] **get_incoming_connections**() `const`

Returns an `Array` of signal connections received by this object. Each connection is represented as a `Dictionary` that contains three entries:

- `signal` is a reference to the `Signal`;
- `callable` is a reference to the `Callable`;
- `flags` is a combination of `ConnectFlags`.

`Variant` **get_indexed**(property_path: `NodePath`) `const`

Gets the object's property indexed by the given `property_path`. The path should be a `NodePath` relative to the current object and can use the colon character (`:`) to access nested properties.

**Examples:** `"position:x"` or `"material:next_pass:blend_mode"`.

``` gdscript
var node = Node2D.new()
node.position = Vector2(5, -10)
var a = node.get_indexed("position")   # a is Vector2(5, -10)
var b = node.get_indexed("position:y") # b is -10
```

``` csharp
var node = new Node2D();
node.Position = new Vector2(5, -10);
var a = node.GetIndexed("position");   // a is Vector2(5, -10)
var b = node.GetIndexed("position:y"); // b is -10
```

**Note:** In C#, `property_path` must be in snake_case when referring to built-in Godot properties. Prefer using the names exposed in the `PropertyName` class to avoid allocating a new `StringName` on each call.

**Note:** This method does not support actual paths to nodes in the `SceneTree`, only sub-property paths. In the context of nodes, use `Node.get_node_and_resource()` instead.

`int` **get_instance_id**() `const`

Returns the object's unique instance ID. This ID can be saved in `EncodedObjectAsID`, and can be used to retrieve this object instance with `@GlobalScope.instance_from_id()`.

**Note:** This ID is only useful during the current session. It won't correspond to a similar object if the ID is sent over a network, or loaded from a file at a later time.

`Variant` **get_meta**(name: `StringName`, default: `Variant` = null) `const`

Returns the object's metadata value for the given entry `name`. If the entry does not exist, returns `default`. If `default` is `null`, an error is also generated.

**Note:** A metadata's name must be a valid identifier as per `StringName.is_valid_identifier()` method.

**Note:** Metadata that has a name starting with an underscore (`_`) is considered editor-only. Editor-only metadata is not displayed in the Inspector and should not be edited, although it can still be found by this method.

`Array`\[`StringName`\] **get_meta_list**() `const`

Returns the object's metadata entry names as an `Array` of `StringName`s.

`int` **get_method_argument_count**(method: `StringName`) `const`

Returns the number of arguments of the given `method` by name.

**Note:** In C#, `method` must be in snake_case when referring to built-in Godot methods. Prefer using the names exposed in the `MethodName` class to avoid allocating a new `StringName` on each call.

`Array`\[`Dictionary`\] **get_method_list**() `const`

Returns this object's methods and their signatures as an `Array` of dictionaries. Each `Dictionary` contains the following entries:

- `name` is the name of the method, as a `String`;
- `args` is an `Array` of dictionaries representing the arguments;
- `default_args` is the default arguments as an `Array` of variants;
- `flags` is a combination of `MethodFlags`;
- `id` is the method's internal identifier `int`;
- `return` is the returned value, as a `Dictionary`;

**Note:** The dictionaries of `args` and `return` are formatted identically to the results of `get_property_list()`, although not all entries are used.

`Array`\[`Dictionary`\] **get_property_list**() `const`

Returns the object's property list as an `Array` of dictionaries. Each `Dictionary` contains the following entries:

- `name` is the property's name, as a `String`;
- `class_name` is an empty `StringName`, unless the property is `@GlobalScope.TYPE_OBJECT` and it inherits from a class;
- `type` is the property's type, as an `int` (see `Variant.Type`);
- `hint` is *how* the property is meant to be edited (see `PropertyHint`);
- `hint_string` depends on the hint (see `PropertyHint`);
- `usage` is a combination of `PropertyUsageFlags`.

**Note:** In GDScript, all class members are treated as properties. In C# and GDExtension, it may be necessary to explicitly mark class members as Godot properties using decorators or attributes.

`Variant` **get_script**() `const`

Returns the object's `Script` instance, or `null` if no script is attached.

`Array`\[`Dictionary`\] **get_signal_connection_list**(signal: `StringName`) `const`

Returns an `Array` of connections for the given `signal` name. Each connection is represented as a `Dictionary` that contains three entries:

- `signal` is a reference to the `Signal`;
- `callable` is a reference to the connected `Callable`;
- `flags` is a combination of `ConnectFlags`.

`Array`\[`Dictionary`\] **get_signal_list**() `const`

Returns the list of existing signals as an `Array` of dictionaries.

**Note:** Due to the implementation, each `Dictionary` is formatted very similarly to the returned values of `get_method_list()`.

`StringName` **get_translation_domain**() `const`

Returns the name of the translation domain used by `tr()` and `tr_n()`. See also `TranslationServer`.

`bool` **has_connections**(signal: `StringName`) `const`

Returns `true` if any connection exists on the given `signal` name.

**Note:** In C#, `signal` must be in snake_case when referring to built-in Godot methods. Prefer using the names exposed in the `SignalName` class to avoid allocating a new `StringName` on each call.

`bool` **has_meta**(name: `StringName`) `const`

Returns `true` if a metadata entry is found with the given `name`. See also `get_meta()`, `set_meta()` and `remove_meta()`.

**Note:** A metadata's name must be a valid identifier as per `StringName.is_valid_identifier()` method.

**Note:** Metadata that has a name starting with an underscore (`_`) is considered editor-only. Editor-only metadata is not displayed in the Inspector and should not be edited, although it can still be found by this method.

`bool` **has_method**(method: `StringName`) `const`

Returns `true` if the given `method` name exists in the object.

**Note:** In C#, `method` must be in snake_case when referring to built-in Godot methods. Prefer using the names exposed in the `MethodName` class to avoid allocating a new `StringName` on each call.

`bool` **has_signal**(signal: `StringName`) `const`

Returns `true` if the given `signal` name exists in the object.

**Note:** In C#, `signal` must be in snake_case when referring to built-in Godot signals. Prefer using the names exposed in the `SignalName` class to avoid allocating a new `StringName` on each call.

`bool` **has_user_signal**(signal: `StringName`) `const`

Returns `true` if the given user-defined `signal` name exists. Only signals added with `add_user_signal()` are included. See also `remove_user_signal()`.

`bool` **is_blocking_signals**() `const`

Returns `true` if the object is blocking its signals from being emitted. See `set_block_signals()`.

`bool` **is_class**(class: `StringName`) `const`

Returns `true` if the object inherits from the given `class`. See also `get_class()`.

``` gdscript
var sprite2d = Sprite2D.new()
sprite2d.is_class("Sprite2D") # Returns true
sprite2d.is_class("Node")     # Returns true
sprite2d.is_class("Node3D")   # Returns false
```

``` csharp
var sprite2D = new Sprite2D();
sprite2D.IsClass("Sprite2D"); // Returns true
sprite2D.IsClass("Node");     // Returns true
sprite2D.IsClass("Node3D");   // Returns false
```

**Note:** This method ignores `class_name` declarations in the object's script.

`bool` **is_connected**(signal: `StringName`, callable: `Callable`) `const`

Returns `true` if a connection exists between the given `signal` name and `callable`.

**Note:** In C#, `signal` must be in snake_case when referring to built-in Godot signals. Prefer using the names exposed in the `SignalName` class to avoid allocating a new `StringName` on each call.

`bool` **is_queued_for_deletion**() `const`

Returns `true` if the methods `Node.queue_free()` or `SceneTree.queue_delete()` was called for the object.

**Note:** This method does not return `true` on children of the node that `Node.queue_free()` has been called on, even though they will be freed together with the parent.

`void (No return value.)` **notification**(what: `int`, reversed: `bool` = false)

Sends the given `what` notification to all classes inherited by the object, triggering calls to `_notification()`, starting from the highest ancestor (the **Object** class) and going down to the object's script.

If `reversed` is `true`, the call order is reversed.

``` gdscript
var player = Node2D.new()
player.set_script(load("res://player.gd"))

player.notification(NOTIFICATION_ENTER_TREE)
# The call order is Object -> Node -> Node2D -> player.gd.

player.notification(NOTIFICATION_ENTER_TREE, true)
# The call order is player.gd -> Node2D -> Node -> Object.
```

``` csharp
var player = new Node2D();
player.SetScript(GD.Load("res://player.gd"));

player.Notification(NotificationEnterTree);
// The call order is GodotObject -> Node -> Node2D -> player.gd.

player.Notification(NotificationEnterTree, true);
// The call order is player.gd -> Node2D -> Node -> GodotObject.
```

`void (No return value.)` **notify_property_list_changed**()

Emits the `property_list_changed` signal. This is mainly used to refresh the editor, so that the Inspector and editor plugins are properly updated.

`bool` **property_can_revert**(property: `StringName`) `const`

Returns `true` if the given `property` has a custom default value. Use `property_get_revert()` to get the `property`'s default value.

**Note:** This method is used by the Inspector dock to display a revert icon. The object must implement `_property_can_revert()` to customize the default value. If `_property_can_revert()` is not implemented, this method returns `false`.

`Variant` **property_get_revert**(property: `StringName`) `const`

Returns the custom default value of the given `property`. Use `property_can_revert()` to check if the `property` has a custom default value.

**Note:** This method is used by the Inspector dock to display a revert icon. The object must implement `_property_get_revert()` to customize the default value. If `_property_get_revert()` is not implemented, this method returns `null`.

`void (No return value.)` **remove_meta**(name: `StringName`)

Removes the given entry `name` from the object's metadata. See also `has_meta()`, `get_meta()` and `set_meta()`.

**Note:** A metadata's name must be a valid identifier as per `StringName.is_valid_identifier()` method.

**Note:** Metadata that has a name starting with an underscore (`_`) is considered editor-only. Editor-only metadata is not displayed in the Inspector and should not be edited, although it can still be found by this method.

`void (No return value.)` **remove_user_signal**(signal: `StringName`)

Removes the given user signal `signal` from the object. See also `add_user_signal()` and `has_user_signal()`.

`void (No return value.)` **set**(property: `StringName`, value: `Variant`)

Assigns `value` to the given `property`. If the property does not exist or the given `value`'s type doesn't match, nothing happens.

``` gdscript
var node = Node2D.new()
node.set("global_scale", Vector2(8, 2.5))
print(node.global_scale) # Prints (8.0, 2.5)
```

``` csharp
var node = new Node2D();
node.Set(Node2D.PropertyName.GlobalScale, new Vector2(8, 2.5f));
GD.Print(node.GlobalScale); // Prints (8, 2.5)
```

**Note:** In C#, `property` must be in snake_case when referring to built-in Godot properties. Prefer using the names exposed in the `PropertyName` class to avoid allocating a new `StringName` on each call.

`void (No return value.)` **set_block_signals**(enable: `bool`)

If set to `true`, the object becomes unable to emit signals. As such, `emit_signal()` and signal connections will not work, until it is set to `false`.

`void (No return value.)` **set_deferred**(property: `StringName`, value: `Variant`)

Assigns `value` to the given `property`, at the end of the current frame. This is equivalent to calling `set()` through `call_deferred()`.

``` gdscript
var node = Node2D.new()
add_child(node)

node.rotation = 1.5
node.set_deferred("rotation", 3.0)
print(node.rotation) # Prints 1.5

await get_tree().process_frame
print(node.rotation) # Prints 3.0
```

``` csharp
var node = new Node2D();
node.Rotation = 1.5f;
node.SetDeferred(Node2D.PropertyName.Rotation, 3f);
GD.Print(node.Rotation); // Prints 1.5

await ToSignal(GetTree(), SceneTree.SignalName.ProcessFrame);
GD.Print(node.Rotation); // Prints 3.0
```

**Note:** In C#, `property` must be in snake_case when referring to built-in Godot properties. Prefer using the names exposed in the `PropertyName` class to avoid allocating a new `StringName` on each call.

`void (No return value.)` **set_indexed**(property_path: `NodePath`, value: `Variant`)

Assigns a new `value` to the property identified by the `property_path`. The path should be a `NodePath` relative to this object, and can use the colon character (`:`) to access nested properties.

``` gdscript
var node = Node2D.new()
node.set_indexed("position", Vector2(42, 0))
node.set_indexed("position:y", -10)
print(node.position) # Prints (42.0, -10.0)
```

``` csharp
var node = new Node2D();
node.SetIndexed("position", new Vector2(42, 0));
node.SetIndexed("position:y", -10);
GD.Print(node.Position); // Prints (42, -10)
```

**Note:** In C#, `property_path` must be in snake_case when referring to built-in Godot properties. Prefer using the names exposed in the `PropertyName` class to avoid allocating a new `StringName` on each call.

`void (No return value.)` **set_message_translation**(enable: `bool`)

If set to `true`, allows the object to translate messages with `tr()` and `tr_n()`. Enabled by default. See also `can_translate_messages()`.

`void (No return value.)` **set_meta**(name: `StringName`, value: `Variant`)

Adds or changes the entry `name` inside the object's metadata. The metadata `value` can be any `Variant`, although some types cannot be serialized correctly.

If `value` is `null`, the entry is removed. This is the equivalent of using `remove_meta()`. See also `has_meta()` and `get_meta()`.

**Note:** A metadata's name must be a valid identifier as per `StringName.is_valid_identifier()` method.

**Note:** Metadata that has a name starting with an underscore (`_`) is considered editor-only. Editor-only metadata is not displayed in the Inspector and should not be edited, although it can still be found by this method.

`void (No return value.)` **set_script**(script: `Variant`)

Attaches `script` to the object, and instantiates it. As a result, the script's `_init()` is called. A `Script` is used to extend the object's functionality.

If a script already exists, its instance is detached, and its property values and state are lost. Built-in property values are still kept.

`void (No return value.)` **set_translation_domain**(domain: `StringName`)

Sets the name of the translation domain used by `tr()` and `tr_n()`. See also `TranslationServer`.

`String` **to_string**()

Returns a `String` representing the object. Defaults to `"<ClassName#RID>"`. Override `_to_string()` to customize the string representation of the object.

`String` **tr**(message: `StringName`, context: `StringName` = &"") `const`

Translates a `message`, using the translation catalogs configured in the Project Settings. Further `context` can be specified to help with the translation. Note that most `Control` nodes automatically translate their strings, so this method is mostly useful for formatted strings or custom drawn text.

If `can_translate_messages()` is `false`, or no translation is available, this method returns the `message` without changes. See `set_message_translation()`.

For detailed examples, see `Internationalizing games `.

**Note:** This method can't be used without an **Object** instance, as it requires the `can_translate_messages()` method. To translate strings in a static context, use `TranslationServer.translate()`.

`String` **tr_n**(message: `StringName`, plural_message: `StringName`, n: `int`, context: `StringName` = &"") `const`

Translates a `message` or `plural_message`, using the translation catalogs configured in the Project Settings. Further `context` can be specified to help with the translation.

If `can_translate_messages()` is `false`, or no translation is available, this method returns `message` or `plural_message`, without changes. See `set_message_translation()`.

The `n` is the number, or amount, of the message's subject. It is used by the translation system to fetch the correct plural form for the current language.

For detailed examples, see `Localization using gettext `.

**Note:** Negative and `float` numbers may not properly apply to some countable subjects. It's recommended to handle these cases with `tr()`.

**Note:** This method can't be used without an **Object** instance, as it requires the `can_translate_messages()` method. To translate strings in a static context, use `TranslationServer.translate_plural()`.
