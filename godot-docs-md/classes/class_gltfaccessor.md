# GLTFAccessor

Represents a glTF accessor.

## Description

GLTFAccessor is a data structure representing a glTF `accessor` that would be found in the `"accessors"` array. A buffer is a blob of binary data. A buffer view is a slice of a buffer. An accessor is a typed interpretation of the data in a buffer view.

Most custom data stored in glTF does not need accessors, only buffer views (see `GLTFBufferView`). Accessors are for more advanced use cases such as interleaved mesh data encoded for the GPU.
