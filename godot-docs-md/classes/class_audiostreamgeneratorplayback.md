# AudioStreamGeneratorPlayback

**Inherits:** `AudioStreamPlaybackResampled` **<** `AudioStreamPlayback` **<** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

Plays back audio generated using `AudioStreamGenerator`.

## Description

This class is meant to be used with `AudioStreamGenerator` to play back the generated audio in real-time.

## Method Descriptions

`bool` **can_push_buffer**(amount: `int`) `const`

Returns `true` if a buffer of the size `amount` can be pushed to the audio sample data buffer without overflowing it, `false` otherwise.

`void (No return value.)` **clear_buffer**()

Clears the audio sample data buffer.

`int` **get_frames_available**() `const`

Returns the number of frames that can be pushed to the audio sample data buffer without overflowing it. If the result is `0`, the buffer is full.

`int` **get_skips**() `const`

Returns the number of times the playback skipped due to a buffer underrun in the audio sample data. This value is reset at the start of the playback.

`bool` **push_buffer**(frames: `PackedVector2Array`)

Pushes several audio data frames to the buffer. This is usually more efficient than `push_frame()` in C# and compiled languages via GDExtension, but `push_buffer()` may be *less* efficient in GDScript.

`bool` **push_frame**(frame: `Vector2`)

Pushes a single audio data frame to the buffer. This is usually less efficient than `push_buffer()` in C# and compiled languages via GDExtension, but `push_frame()` may be *more* efficient in GDScript.
