# Semaphore

**Inherits:** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

A synchronization mechanism used to control access to a shared resource by `Thread`s.

## Description

A synchronization semaphore that can be used to synchronize multiple `Thread`s. Initialized to zero on creation. For a binary version, see `Mutex`.

**Warning:** Semaphores must be used carefully to avoid deadlocks.

**Warning:** To guarantee that the operating system is able to perform proper cleanup (no crashes, no deadlocks), these conditions must be met:

- When a **Semaphore**'s reference count reaches zero and it is therefore destroyed, no threads must be waiting on it.
- When a `Thread`'s reference count reaches zero and it is therefore destroyed, it must not be waiting on any semaphore.

## Method Descriptions

`void (No return value.)` **post**(count: `int` = 1)

Lowers the **Semaphore**, allowing one thread in, or more if `count` is specified.

`bool` **try_wait**()

Like `wait()`, but won't block, so if the value is zero, fails immediately and returns `false`. If non-zero, it returns `true` to report success.

`void (No return value.)` **wait**()

Waits for the **Semaphore**, if its value is zero, blocks until non-zero.
