# JavaScriptBridge

**Inherits:** `Object`

Singleton that connects the engine with the browser's JavaScript context in Web export.

## Description

The JavaScriptBridge singleton is implemented only in the Web export. It's used to access the browser's JavaScript context. This allows interaction with embedding pages or calling third-party JavaScript APIs.

**Note:** This singleton can be disabled at build-time to improve security. By default, the JavaScriptBridge singleton is enabled. Official export templates also have the JavaScriptBridge singleton enabled. See `Compiling for the Web ` in the documentation for more information.

## Signals

**pwa_update_available**()

Emitted when an update for this progressive web app has been detected but is waiting to be activated because a previous version is active. See `pwa_update()` to force the update to take place immediately.

## Method Descriptions

`JavaScriptObject` **create_callback**(callable: `Callable`)

Creates a reference to a `Callable` that can be used as a callback by JavaScript. The reference must be kept until the callback happens, or it won't be called at all. See `JavaScriptObject` for usage.

**Note:** The callback function must take exactly one `Array` argument, which is going to be the JavaScript [arguments object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments) converted to an array.

`Variant` **create_object**(object: `String`, ...) `vararg`

Creates a new JavaScript object using the `new` constructor. The `object` must a valid property of the JavaScript `window`. See `JavaScriptObject` for usage.

`void (No return value.)` **download_buffer**(buffer: `PackedByteArray`, name: `String`, mime: `String` = "application/octet-stream")

Prompts the user to download a file containing the specified `buffer`. The file will have the given `name` and `mime` type.

**Note:** The browser may override the [MIME type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type) provided based on the file `name`'s extension.

**Note:** Browsers might block the download if `download_buffer()` is not being called from a user interaction (e.g. button click).

**Note:** Browsers might ask the user for permission or block the download if multiple download requests are made in a quick succession.

`Variant` **eval**(code: `String`, use_global_execution_context: `bool` = false)

Execute the string `code` as JavaScript code within the browser window. This is a call to the actual global JavaScript function `eval()`.

If `use_global_execution_context` is `true`, the code will be evaluated in the global execution context. Otherwise, it is evaluated in the execution context of a function within the engine's runtime environment.

`void (No return value.)` **force_fs_sync**()

Force synchronization of the persistent file system (when enabled).

**Note:** This is only useful for modules or extensions that can't use `FileAccess` to write files.

`JavaScriptObject` **get_interface**(interface: `String`)

Returns an interface to a JavaScript object that can be used by scripts. The `interface` must be a valid property of the JavaScript `window`. The callback must accept a single `Array` argument, which will contain the JavaScript `arguments`. See `JavaScriptObject` for usage.

`bool` **is_js_buffer**(javascript_object: `JavaScriptObject`)

Returns `true` if the given `javascript_object` is of type [ArrayBuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer), [DataView](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DataView), or one of the many [typed array objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray).

`PackedByteArray` **js_buffer_to_packed_byte_array**(javascript_buffer: `JavaScriptObject`)

Returns a copy of `javascript_buffer`'s contents as a `PackedByteArray`. See also `is_js_buffer()`.

`bool` **pwa_needs_update**() `const`

Returns `true` if a new version of the progressive web app is waiting to be activated.

**Note:** Only relevant when exported as a Progressive Web App.

`Error` **pwa_update**()

Performs the live update of the progressive web app. Forcing the new version to be installed and the page to be reloaded.

**Note:** Your application will be **reloaded in all browser tabs**.

**Note:** Only relevant when exported as a Progressive Web App and `pwa_needs_update()` returns `true`.
