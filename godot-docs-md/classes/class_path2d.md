# Path2D

**Inherits:** `Node2D` **<** `CanvasItem` **<** `Node` **<** `Object`

Contains a `Curve2D` path for `PathFollow2D` nodes to follow.

## Description

Can have `PathFollow2D` child nodes moving along the `Curve2D`. See `PathFollow2D` for more information on usage.

**Note:** The path is considered as relative to the moved nodes (children of `PathFollow2D`). As such, the curve should usually start with a zero vector (`(0, 0)`).

## Property Descriptions

- `void (No return value.)` **set_curve**(value: `Curve2D`)
- `Curve2D` **get_curve**()
