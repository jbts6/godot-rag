# Projection

A 4×4 matrix for 3D projective transformations.

## Description

A 4×4 matrix used for 3D projective transformations. It can represent transformations such as translation, rotation, scaling, shearing, and perspective division. It consists of four `Vector4` columns.

For purely linear transformations (translation, rotation, and scale), it is recommended to use `Transform3D`, as it is more performant and requires less memory.

Used internally as `Camera3D`'s projection matrix.

**Note:** In a boolean context, a projection will evaluate to `false` if it's equal to `IDENTITY`. Otherwise, a projection will always evaluate to `true`.

> [!NOTE]
> There are notable differences when using this API with C#. See `doc_c_sharp_differences` for more information.

## Enumerations

`Planes` **PLANE_NEAR** = `0`

## Constants

**IDENTITY** = `Projection(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1)`

A **Projection** with no transformation defined. When applied to other data structures, no transformation is performed.
