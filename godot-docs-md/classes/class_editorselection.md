# EditorSelection

**Inherits:** `Object`

Manages the SceneTree selection in the editor.

## Description

This object manages the SceneTree selection in the editor.

**Note:** This class shouldn't be instantiated directly. Instead, access the singleton using `EditorInterface.get_selection()`.

## Signals

**selection_changed**()

Emitted when the selection changes.

## Method Descriptions

`void (No return value.)` **add_node**(node: `Node`)

Adds a node to the selection.

**Note:** The newly selected node will not be automatically edited in the inspector. If you want to edit a node, use `EditorInterface.edit_node()`.

`void (No return value.)` **clear**()

Clear the selection.

`Array`\[`Node`\] **get_selected_nodes**()

Returns the list of selected nodes.

`Array`\[`Node`\] **get_top_selected_nodes**()

Returns the list of top selected nodes only, excluding any children. This is useful for performing transform operations (moving them, rotating, etc.).

For example, if there is a node A with a child B and a sibling C, then selecting all three will cause this method to return only A and C. Changing the global transform of A will affect the global transform of B, so there is no need to change B separately.

`Array`\[`Node`\] **get_transformable_selected_nodes**()

**Deprecated:** Use `get_top_selected_nodes()` instead.

Returns the list of top selected nodes only, excluding any children. This is useful for performing transform operations (moving them, rotating, etc.). See `get_top_selected_nodes()`.

`void (No return value.)` **remove_node**(node: `Node`)

Removes a node from the selection.
