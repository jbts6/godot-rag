# ZIPPacker

**Inherits:** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

Allows the creation of ZIP files.

## Description

This class implements a writer that allows storing the multiple blobs in a ZIP archive. See also `ZIPReader` and `PCKPacker`.

    # Create a ZIP archive with a single file at its root.
    func write_zip_file():
        var writer = ZIPPacker.new()
        var err = writer.open("user://archive.zip")
        if err != OK:
            return err
        writer.start_file("hello.txt")
        writer.write_file("Hello World".to_utf8_buffer())
        writer.close_file()

        writer.close()
        return OK

## Enumerations

enum **ZipAppend**:

`ZipAppend` **APPEND_CREATE** = `0`

Create a new zip archive at the given path.

`ZipAppend` **APPEND_CREATEAFTER** = `1`

Append a new zip archive to the end of the already existing file at the given path.

`ZipAppend` **APPEND_ADDINZIP** = `2`

Add new files to the existing zip archive at the given path.

enum **CompressionLevel**:

`CompressionLevel` **COMPRESSION_DEFAULT** = `-1`

Start a file with the default Deflate compression level (`6`). This is a good compromise between speed and file size.

`CompressionLevel` **COMPRESSION_NONE** = `0`

Start a file with no compression. This is also known as the "Store" compression mode and is the fastest method of packing files inside a ZIP archive. Consider using this mode for files that are already compressed (such as JPEG, PNG, MP3, or Ogg Vorbis files).

`CompressionLevel` **COMPRESSION_FAST** = `1`

Start a file with the fastest Deflate compression level (`1`). This is fast to compress, but results in larger file sizes than `COMPRESSION_DEFAULT`. Decompression speed is generally unaffected by the chosen compression level.

`CompressionLevel` **COMPRESSION_BEST** = `9`

Start a file with the best Deflate compression level (`9`). This is slow to compress, but results in smaller file sizes than `COMPRESSION_DEFAULT`. Decompression speed is generally unaffected by the chosen compression level.

## Property Descriptions

`int` **compression_level** = `-1`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_compression_level**(value: `int`)
- `int` **get_compression_level**()

The compression level used when `start_file()` is called. Use `CompressionLevel` as a reference.

## Method Descriptions

`Error` **add_directory**(path: `String`, permissions: `BitField (This value is an integer composed as a bitmask of the following flags.)`\[`UnixPermissionFlags`\] = 493, modified_time: `int` = 0)

Adds directory to the archive. If `modified_time` is set to `0`, current system time is used.

**Note:** Directories are automatically created when `start_file()` is called, use this function before adding files to create directories with custom permissions and modification time.

`Error` **close**()

Closes the underlying resources used by this instance.

`Error` **close_file**()

Stops writing to a file within the archive.

It will fail if there is no open file.

`Error` **open**(path: `String`, append: `ZipAppend` = 0)

Opens a zip file for writing at the given path using the specified write mode.

This must be called before everything else.

`Error` **start_file**(path: `String`, permissions: `BitField (This value is an integer composed as a bitmask of the following flags.)`\[`UnixPermissionFlags`\] = 420, modified_time: `int` = 0)

Starts writing to a file within the archive. Only one file can be written at the same time. If `modified_time` is set to `0`, current system time is used.

Must be called after `open()`.

`Error` **write_file**(data: `PackedByteArray`)

Write the given `data` to the file.

Needs to be called after `start_file()`.
