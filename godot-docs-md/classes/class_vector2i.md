# Vector2i

A 2D vector using integer coordinates.

## Description

A 2-element structure that can be used to represent 2D grid coordinates or any other pair of integers.

It uses integer coordinates and is therefore preferable to `Vector2` when exact precision is required. Note that the values are limited to 32 bits, and unlike `Vector2` this cannot be configured with an engine build option. Use `int` or `PackedInt64Array` if 64-bit values are needed.

**Note:** In a boolean context, a Vector2i will evaluate to `false` if it's equal to `Vector2i(0, 0)`. Otherwise, a Vector2i will always evaluate to `true`.

**RIGHT** = `Vector2i(1, 0)`

## Constructor Descriptions

`Vector2i` **Vector2i**()

Constructs a default-initialized **Vector2i** with all components set to `0`.

`Vector2i` **Vector2i**(from: `Vector2i`)

Constructs a **Vector2i** as a copy of the given **Vector2i**.

`Vector2i` **Vector2i**(from: `Vector2`)

Constructs a new **Vector2i** from the given `Vector2` by truncating components' fractional parts (rounding towards zero). For a different behavior consider passing the result of `Vector2.ceil()`, `Vector2.floor()` or `Vector2.round()` to this constructor instead.

`Vector2i` **Vector2i**(x: `int`, y: `int`)

Constructs a new **Vector2i** from the given `x` and `y`.

## Method Descriptions

`Vector2i` **abs**() `const`

Returns a new vector with all components in absolute values (i.e. positive).

`float` **aspect**() `const`

Returns the aspect ratio of this vector, the ratio of `x` to `y`.

`Vector2i` **clamp**(min: `Vector2i`, max: `Vector2i`) `const`

Returns a new vector with all components clamped between the components of `min` and `max`, by running `@GlobalScope.clamp()` on each component.

`Vector2i` **clampi**(min: `int`, max: `int`) `const`

Returns a new vector with all components clamped between `min` and `max`, by running `@GlobalScope.clamp()` on each component.

`int` **distance_squared_to**(to: `Vector2i`) `const`

Returns the squared [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) between this vector and `to`.

This method runs faster than `distance_to()`, so prefer it if you need to compare vectors or need the squared distance for some formula.

`float` **distance_to**(to: `Vector2i`) `const`

Returns the [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) between this vector and `to`.

`float` **length**() `const`

Returns the length (magnitude) of this vector.

`int` **length_squared**() `const`

Returns the squared length (squared magnitude) of this vector.

This method runs faster than `length()`, so prefer it if you need to compare vectors or need the squared distance for some formula.

`Vector2i` **max**(with: `Vector2i`) `const`

Returns the component-wise maximum of this and `with`, equivalent to `Vector2i(maxi(x, with.x), maxi(y, with.y))`.

`int` **max_axis_index**() `const`

Returns the axis of the vector's highest value. See `AXIS_*` constants. If all components are equal, this method returns `AXIS_X`.

`Vector2i` **maxi**(with: `int`) `const`

Returns the component-wise maximum of this and `with`, equivalent to `Vector2i(maxi(x, with), maxi(y, with))`.

`Vector2i` **min**(with: `Vector2i`) `const`

Returns the component-wise minimum of this and `with`, equivalent to `Vector2i(mini(x, with.x), mini(y, with.y))`.

`int` **min_axis_index**() `const`

Returns the axis of the vector's lowest value. See `AXIS_*` constants. If all components are equal, this method returns `AXIS_Y`.

`Vector2i` **mini**(with: `int`) `const`

Returns the component-wise minimum of this and `with`, equivalent to `Vector2i(mini(x, with), mini(y, with))`.

`Vector2i` **sign**() `const`

Returns a new vector with each component set to `1` if it's positive, `-1` if it's negative, and `0` if it's zero. The result is identical to calling `@GlobalScope.sign()` on each component.

`Vector2i` **snapped**(step: `Vector2i`) `const`

Returns a new vector with each component snapped to the closest multiple of the corresponding component in `step`.

`Vector2i` **snappedi**(step: `int`) `const`

Returns a new vector with each component snapped to the closest multiple of `step`.

## Operator Descriptions

`bool` **operator !=**(right: `Vector2i`)

Returns `true` if the vectors are not equal.

`Vector2i` **operator %**(right: `Vector2i`)

Gets the remainder of each component of the **Vector2i** with the components of the given **Vector2i**. This operation uses truncated division, which is often not desired as it does not work well with negative numbers. Consider using `@GlobalScope.posmod()` instead if you want to handle negative numbers.

    print(Vector2i(10, -20) % Vector2i(7, 8)) # Prints (3, -4)

`Vector2i` **operator %**(right: `int`)

Gets the remainder of each component of the **Vector2i** with the given `int`. This operation uses truncated division, which is often not desired as it does not work well with negative numbers. Consider using `@GlobalScope.posmod()` instead if you want to handle negative numbers.

    print(Vector2i(10, -20) % 7) # Prints (3, -6)

`Vector2i` **operator***(right: `Vector2i`)

Multiplies each component of the **Vector2i** by the components of the given **Vector2i**.

    print(Vector2i(10, 20) * Vector2i(3, 4)) # Prints (30, 80)

`Vector2` **operator***(right: `float`)

`Vector2i` **operator -**(right: `Vector2i`)

Subtracts each component of the **Vector2i** by the components of the given **Vector2i**.

    print(Vector2i(10, 20) - Vector2i(3, 4)) # Prints (7, 16)

`Vector2i` **operator /**(right: `Vector2i`)

Divides each component of the **Vector2i** by the components of the given **Vector2i**.

    print(Vector2i(10, 20) / Vector2i(2, 5)) # Prints (5, 4)

`Vector2` **operator /**(right: `float`)

Divides each component of the **Vector2i** by the given `float`. Returns a `Vector2`.

    print(Vector2i(1, 2) / 2.5) # Prints (0.4, 0.8)

`Vector2i` **operator /**(right: `int`)

Divides each component of the **Vector2i** by the given `int`.

`bool` **operator <**(right: `Vector2i`)

Compares two **Vector2i** vectors by first checking if the X value of the left vector is less than the X value of the `right` vector. If the X values are exactly equal, then it repeats this check with the Y values of the two vectors. This operator is useful for sorting vectors.

`bool` **operator <=**(right: `Vector2i`)

Compares two **Vector2i** vectors by first checking if the X value of the left vector is less than or equal to the X value of the `right` vector. If the X values are exactly equal, then it repeats this check with the Y values of the two vectors. This operator is useful for sorting vectors.

`bool` **operator ==**(right: `Vector2i`)

Returns `true` if the vectors are equal.

`bool` **operator \>**(right: `Vector2i`)

Compares two **Vector2i** vectors by first checking if the X value of the left vector is greater than the X value of the `right` vector. If the X values are exactly equal, then it repeats this check with the Y values of the two vectors. This operator is useful for sorting vectors.

`bool` **operator \>=**(right: `Vector2i`)

Compares two **Vector2i** vectors by first checking if the X value of the left vector is greater than or equal to the X value of the `right` vector. If the X values are exactly equal, then it repeats this check with the Y values of the two vectors. This operator is useful for sorting vectors.

`int` **operator \[\]**(index: `int`)

Access vector components using their `index`. `v[0]` is equivalent to `v.x`, and `v[1]` is equivalent to `v.y`.

`Vector2i` **operator unary+**()

Returns the same value as if the `+` was not there. Unary `+` does nothing, but sometimes it can make your code more readable.

`Vector2i` **operator unary-**()

Returns the negative value of the **Vector2i**. This is the same as writing `Vector2i(-v.x, -v.y)`. This operation flips the direction of the vector while keeping the same magnitude.
