A `SkeletonModifier3D` for aligning bones along a `Path3D`.

## Description

A `SkeletonModifier3D` for aligning bones along a `Path3D`. The smoothness of the fitting depends on the `Curve3D.bake_interval`.

If you want the `Path3D` to attach to a specific bone, it is recommended to place a `ModifierBoneTarget3D` before the **SplineIK3D** in the `SkeletonModifier3D` list (children of the `Skeleton3D`), and then place a `Path3D` as the `ModifierBoneTarget3D`'s child.

Bone twist is determined based on the `Curve3D.get_point_tilt()`.

If the root bone joint and the start point of the `Curve3D` are separated, it assumes that there is a linear line segment between them. This means that the vector pointing toward the start point of the `Curve3D` takes precedence over the shortest intersection point along the `Curve3D`.

If the end bone joint exceeds the path length, it is bent as close as possible to the end point of the `Curve3D`.

**Note:** All the methods in this class take an `index` parameter. This parameter specifies which setting list entry to return if the IK has multiple entries (e.g. `settings/<index>/root_bone_name`).

## Property Descriptions

`int` **setting_count** = `0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_setting_count**(value: `int`)
- `int` **get_setting_count**()

The number of settings.

## Method Descriptions

`NodePath` **get_path_3d**(index: `int`) `const`

Returns the node path of the `Path3D` which is describing the path.

`int` **get_tilt_fade_in**(index: `int`) `const`

Returns the tilt interpolation method used between the root bone and the start point of the `Curve3D` when they are apart. See also `set_tilt_fade_in()`.

`int` **get_tilt_fade_out**(index: `int`) `const`

Returns the tilt interpolation method used between the end bone and the end point of the `Curve3D` when they are apart. See also `set_tilt_fade_out()`.

`bool` **is_tilt_enabled**(index: `int`) `const`

Returns if the tilt property of the `Curve3D` affects the bone twist.

`void (No return value.)` **set_path_3d**(index: `int`, path_3d: `NodePath`)

Sets the node path of the `Path3D` which is describing the path.

`void (No return value.)` **set_tilt_enabled**(index: `int`, enabled: `bool`)

Sets if the tilt property of the `Curve3D` should affect the bone twist.

`void (No return value.)` **set_tilt_fade_in**(index: `int`, size: `int`)

If `size` is greater than `0`, the tilt is interpolated between `size` start bones from the start point of the `Curve3D` when they are apart.

If `size` is equal `0`, the tilts between the root bone head and the start point of the `Curve3D` are unified with a tilt of the start point of the `Curve3D`.

If `size` is less than `0`, the tilts between the root bone and the start point of the `Curve3D` are `0.0`.

`void (No return value.)` **set_tilt_fade_out**(index: `int`, size: `int`)

If `size` is greater than `0`, the tilt is interpolated between `size` end bones from the end point of the `Curve3D` when they are apart.

If `size` is equal `0`, the tilts between the end bone tail and the end point of the `Curve3D` are unified with a tilt of the end point of the `Curve3D`.

If `size` is less than `0`, the tilts between the end bone and the end point of the `Curve3D` are `0.0`.
