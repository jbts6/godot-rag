# EditorResourceConversionPlugin

**Inherits:** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

Plugin for adding custom converters from one resource format to another in the editor resource picker context menu; for example, converting a `StandardMaterial3D` to a `ShaderMaterial`.

## Description

**EditorResourceConversionPlugin** is invoked when the context menu is brought up for a resource in the editor inspector. Relevant conversion plugins will appear as menu options to convert the given resource to a target type.

Below shows an example of a basic plugin that will convert an `ImageTexture` to a `PortableCompressedTexture2D`.

``` gdscript
extends EditorResourceConversionPlugin

func _handles(resource: Resource):
    return resource is ImageTexture

func _converts_to():
    return "PortableCompressedTexture2D"

func _convert(itex: Resource):
    var ptex = PortableCompressedTexture2D.new()
    ptex.create_from_image(itex.get_image(), PortableCompressedTexture2D.COMPRESSION_MODE_LOSSLESS)
    return ptex
```

To use an **EditorResourceConversionPlugin**, register it using the `EditorPlugin.add_resource_conversion_plugin()` method first.

## Method Descriptions

`Resource` **\_convert**(resource: `Resource`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `const`

Takes an input `Resource` and converts it to the type given in `_converts_to()`. The returned `Resource` is the result of the conversion, and the input `Resource` remains unchanged.

`String` **\_converts_to**() `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `const`

Returns the class name of the target type of `Resource` that this plugin converts source resources to.

`bool` **\_handles**(resource: `Resource`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `const`

Called to determine whether a particular `Resource` can be converted to the target resource type by this plugin.
