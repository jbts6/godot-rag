# AudioEffectRecord

**Inherits:** `AudioEffect` **<** `Resource` **<** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

Audio effect used for recording the sound from an audio bus.

## Description

Allows the user to record the sound from an audio bus into an `AudioStreamWAV`. When used on the Master audio bus, this includes all audio output by Godot.

Unlike `AudioEffectCapture`, this effect encodes the recording with the given format (8-bit, 16-bit, or compressed) instead of giving access to the raw audio samples.

Can be used (with an `AudioStreamMicrophone`) to record from a microphone.

**Note:** `ProjectSettings.audio/driver/enable_input` must be `true` for audio input to work. See also that setting's description for caveats related to permissions and operating system privacy settings.
