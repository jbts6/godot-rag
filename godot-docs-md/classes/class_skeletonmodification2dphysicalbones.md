# SkeletonModification2DPhysicalBones

**Experimental:** Physical bones may be changed in the future to perform the position update of `Bone2D` on their own, without needing this resource.

**Inherits:** `SkeletonModification2D` **<** `Resource` **<** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

A modification that applies the transforms of `PhysicalBone2D` nodes to `Bone2D` nodes.

## Description

This modification takes the transforms of `PhysicalBone2D` nodes and applies them to `Bone2D` nodes. This allows the `Bone2D` nodes to react to physics thanks to the linked `PhysicalBone2D` nodes.

## Property Descriptions

`int` **physical_bone_chain_length** = `0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_physical_bone_chain_length**(value: `int`)
- `int` **get_physical_bone_chain_length**()

The number of `PhysicalBone2D` nodes linked in this modification.

## Method Descriptions

`void (No return value.)` **fetch_physical_bones**()

Empties the list of `PhysicalBone2D` nodes and populates it with all `PhysicalBone2D` nodes that are children of the `Skeleton2D`.

`NodePath` **get_physical_bone_node**(joint_idx: `int`) `const`

Returns the `PhysicalBone2D` node at `joint_idx`.

`void (No return value.)` **set_physical_bone_node**(joint_idx: `int`, physicalbone2d_node: `NodePath`)

Sets the `PhysicalBone2D` node at `joint_idx`.

**Note:** This is just the index used for this modification, not the bone index used in the `Skeleton2D`.

`void (No return value.)` **start_simulation**(bones: `Array`\[`StringName`\] = \[\])

Tell the `PhysicalBone2D` nodes to start simulating and interacting with the physics world.

Optionally, an array of bone names can be passed to this function, and that will cause only `PhysicalBone2D` nodes with those names to start simulating.

`void (No return value.)` **stop_simulation**(bones: `Array`\[`StringName`\] = \[\])

Tell the `PhysicalBone2D` nodes to stop simulating and interacting with the physics world.

Optionally, an array of bone names can be passed to this function, and that will cause only `PhysicalBone2D` nodes with those names to stop simulating.
