Abstract base class for 2D game objects affected by physics.

## Description

**PhysicsBody2D** is an abstract base class for 2D game objects affected by physics. All 2D physics bodies inherit from it.

## Method Descriptions

`void (No return value.)` **add_collision_exception_with**(body: `Node`)

Adds a body to the list of bodies that this body can't collide with.

`Array`\[`PhysicsBody2D`\] **get_collision_exceptions**()

Returns an array of nodes that were added as collision exceptions for this body.

`Vector2` **get_gravity**() `const`

Returns the gravity vector computed from all sources that can affect the body, including all gravity overrides from `Area2D` nodes and the global world gravity.

`KinematicCollision2D` **move_and_collide**(motion: `Vector2`, test_only: `bool` = false, safe_margin: `float` = 0.08, recovery_as_collision: `bool` = false)

Moves the body along the vector `motion`. In order to be frame rate independent in `Node._physics_process()` or `Node._process()`, `motion` should be computed using `delta`.

Returns a `KinematicCollision2D`, which contains information about the collision when stopped, or when touching another body along the motion.

If `test_only` is `true`, the body does not move but the would-be collision information is given.

`safe_margin` is the extra margin used for collision recovery (see `CharacterBody2D.safe_margin` for more details).

If `recovery_as_collision` is `true`, any depenetration from the recovery phase is also reported as a collision; this is used e.g. by `CharacterBody2D` for improving floor detection during floor snapping.

`void (No return value.)` **remove_collision_exception_with**(body: `Node`)

Removes a body from the list of bodies that this body can't collide with.

`bool` **test_move**(from: `Transform2D`, motion: `Vector2`, collision: `KinematicCollision2D` = null, safe_margin: `float` = 0.08, recovery_as_collision: `bool` = false)

Checks for collisions without moving the body. In order to be frame rate independent in `Node._physics_process()` or `Node._process()`, `motion` should be computed using `delta`.

Virtually sets the node's position, scale and rotation to that of the given `Transform2D`, then tries to move the body along the vector `motion`. Returns `true` if a collision would stop the body from moving along the whole path.

`collision` is an optional object of type `KinematicCollision2D`, which contains additional information about the collision when stopped, or when touching another body along the motion.

`safe_margin` is the extra margin used for collision recovery (see `CharacterBody2D.safe_margin` for more details).

If `recovery_as_collision` is `true`, any depenetration from the recovery phase is also reported as a collision; this is useful for checking whether the body would *touch* any other bodies.
