# BaseButton

**Inherits:** `Control` **<** `CanvasItem` **<** `Node` **<** `Object`

**Inherited By:** `Button`, `LinkButton`, `TextureButton`

Abstract base class for GUI buttons.

## Description

**BaseButton** is an abstract base class for GUI buttons. It doesn't display anything by itself.

## Signals

**button_down**()

Emitted when the button starts being held down.

**button_up**()

Emitted when the button stops being held down.

**pressed**()

Emitted when the button is toggled or pressed. This is on `button_down` if `action_mode` is `ACTION_MODE_BUTTON_PRESS` and on `button_up` otherwise.

If you need to know the button's pressed state (and `toggle_mode` is active), use `toggled` instead.

**toggled**(toggled_on: `bool`)

Emitted when the button was just toggled between pressed and normal states (only if `toggle_mode` is active). The new state is contained in the `toggled_on` argument.

## Enumerations

enum **DrawMode**:

`DrawMode` **DRAW_NORMAL** = `0`

The normal state (i.e. not pressed, not hovered, not toggled and enabled) of buttons.

`DrawMode` **DRAW_PRESSED** = `1`

The state of buttons are pressed.

`DrawMode` **DRAW_HOVER** = `2`

The state of buttons are hovered.

`DrawMode` **DRAW_DISABLED** = `3`

The state of buttons are disabled.

`DrawMode` **DRAW_HOVER_PRESSED** = `4`

The state of buttons are both hovered and pressed.

enum **ActionMode**:

`ActionMode` **ACTION_MODE_BUTTON_PRESS** = `0`

Require just a press to consider the button clicked.

`ActionMode` **ACTION_MODE_BUTTON_RELEASE** = `1`

Require a press and a subsequent release before considering the button clicked.

## Property Descriptions

`ActionMode` **action_mode** = `1`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_action_mode**(value: `ActionMode`)
- `ActionMode` **get_action_mode**()

Determines when the button is considered clicked.

`ButtonGroup` **button_group**

- `void (No return value.)` **set_button_group**(value: `ButtonGroup`)
- `ButtonGroup` **get_button_group**()

The `ButtonGroup` associated with the button. Not to be confused with node groups.

**Note:** The button will be configured as a radio button if a `ButtonGroup` is assigned to it.

`BitField (This value is an integer composed as a bitmask of the following flags.)`\[`MouseButtonMask`\] **button_mask** = `1`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_button_mask**(value: `BitField (This value is an integer composed as a bitmask of the following flags.)`\[`MouseButtonMask`\])
- `BitField (This value is an integer composed as a bitmask of the following flags.)`\[`MouseButtonMask`\] **get_button_mask**()

Binary mask to choose which mouse buttons this button will respond to.

To allow both left-click and right-click, use `MOUSE_BUTTON_MASK_LEFT | MOUSE_BUTTON_MASK_RIGHT`.

`bool` **button_pressed** = `false`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_pressed**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **is_pressed**()

If `true`, the button's state is pressed. Means the button is pressed down or toggled (if `toggle_mode` is active). Only works if `toggle_mode` is `true`.

**Note:** Changing the value of `button_pressed` will result in `toggled` to be emitted. If you want to change the pressed state without emitting that signal, use `set_pressed_no_signal()`.

`bool` **disabled** = `false`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_disabled**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **is_disabled**()

If `true`, the button is in disabled state and can't be clicked or toggled.

**Note:** If the button is disabled while held down, `button_up` will be emitted.

`bool` **keep_pressed_outside** = `false`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_keep_pressed_outside**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **is_keep_pressed_outside**()

If `true`, the button stays pressed when moving the cursor outside the button while pressing it.

**Note:** This property only affects the button's visual appearance. Signals will be emitted at the same moment regardless of this property's value.

`Shortcut` **shortcut**

- `void (No return value.)` **set_shortcut**(value: `Shortcut`)
- `Shortcut` **get_shortcut**()

`Shortcut` associated to the button.

`bool` **shortcut_feedback** = `true`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_shortcut_feedback**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **is_shortcut_feedback**()

If `true`, the button will highlight for a short amount of time when its shortcut is activated. If `false` and `toggle_mode` is `false`, the shortcut will activate without any visual feedback.

`bool` **shortcut_in_tooltip** = `true`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_shortcut_in_tooltip**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **is_shortcut_in_tooltip_enabled**()

If `true`, the button will add information about its shortcut in the tooltip. This includes the shortcut's events and its `Resource.resource_name`. If both events and name are empty, the shortcut will not be included.

**Note:** This property does nothing when the tooltip control is customized using `Control._make_custom_tooltip()`.

`bool` **toggle_mode** = `false`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_toggle_mode**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **is_toggle_mode**()

If `true`, the button is in toggle mode. Makes the button flip state between pressed and unpressed each time its area is clicked.

## Method Descriptions

`void (No return value.)` **\_pressed**() `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`

Called when the button is pressed. If you need to know the button's pressed state (and `toggle_mode` is active), use `_toggled()` instead.

`void (No return value.)` **\_toggled**(toggled_on: `bool`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`

Called when the button is toggled (only if `toggle_mode` is active).

`DrawMode` **get_draw_mode**() `const`

Returns the visual state used to draw the button. This is useful mainly when implementing your own draw code by either overriding draw() or connecting to "draw" signal. The visual state of the button is defined by the `DrawMode` enum.

`bool` **is_hovered**() `const`

Returns `true` if the mouse has entered the button and has not left it yet.

`void (No return value.)` **set_pressed_no_signal**(pressed: `bool`)

Changes the `button_pressed` state of the button, without emitting `toggled`. Use when you just want to change the state of the button without sending the pressed event (e.g. when initializing scene). Only works if `toggle_mode` is `true`.

**Note:** This method doesn't unpress other buttons in `button_group`.
