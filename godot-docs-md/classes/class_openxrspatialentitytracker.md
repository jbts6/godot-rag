# OpenXRSpatialEntityTracker

**Experimental:** This class may be changed or removed in future versions.

**Inherits:** `XRPositionalTracker` **<** `XRTracker` **<** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

**Inherited By:** `OpenXRAnchorTracker`, `OpenXRMarkerTracker`, `OpenXRPlaneTracker`

Base class for Positional trackers managed by OpenXR's spatial entity extensions.

## Description

These are trackers created and managed by OpenXR's spatial entity extensions that give access to specific data related to OpenXR's spatial entities. They will always be of type `TRACKER_ANCHOR`.

## Signals

**next_changed**()

Emitted when the next-chain changes, from either `add_next()` or `remove_next()`.

**spatial_tracking_state_changed**(spatial_tracking_state: `int`)

There is currently no description for this signal. Please help us by [contributing one](https://contributing.godotengine.org/en/latest/documentation/class_reference.html)!

## Enumerations

enum **EntityTrackingState**:

`EntityTrackingState` **ENTITY_TRACKING_STATE_STOPPED** = `1`

This anchor has stopped tracking.

`EntityTrackingState` **ENTITY_TRACKING_STATE_PAUSED** = `2`

Tracking is currently paused.

`EntityTrackingState` **ENTITY_TRACKING_STATE_TRACKING** = `3`

This anchor is currently being tracked.

## Property Descriptions

`RID` **entity** = `RID()`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_entity**(value: `RID`)
- `RID` **get_entity**()

The spatial entity associated with this tracker.

`EntityTrackingState` **spatial_tracking_state** = `2`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_spatial_tracking_state**(value: `EntityTrackingState`)
- `EntityTrackingState` **get_spatial_tracking_state**()

The spatial tracking state for this tracker.

## Method Descriptions

`void (No return value.)` **add_next**(next: `OpenXRStructureBase`)

Adds a new `OpenXRStructureBase` to the next-chain.

`get_next()` will return this `next` until either `add_next()` is called again or it's removed in `remove_next()`.

`OpenXRStructureBase` **get_next**() `const`

Gets the head `OpenXRStructureBase` in the next-chain.

See also `add_next()` and `remove_next()`.

`RID` **get_spatial_context**() `const`

Gets the spatial context used to create this **OpenXRSpatialEntityTracker**.

`void (No return value.)` **remove_next**(next: `OpenXRStructureBase`)

Removes a `next` object previously added in `add_next()` from the next-chain.

`void (No return value.)` **set_spatial_context**(spatial_context: `RID`)

Sets the spatial context used to create this tracker.
