# AudioEffect

**Inherits:** `Resource` **<** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

**Inherited By:** `AudioEffectAmplify`, `AudioEffectCapture`, `AudioEffectChorus`, `AudioEffectCompressor`, `AudioEffectDelay`, `AudioEffectDistortion`, `AudioEffectEQ`, `AudioEffectFilter`, `AudioEffectHardLimiter`, `AudioEffectLimiter`, `AudioEffectPanner`, `AudioEffectPhaser`, `AudioEffectPitchShift`, `AudioEffectRecord`, `AudioEffectReverb`, `AudioEffectSpectrumAnalyzer`, `AudioEffectStereoEnhance`

Base class for audio effect resources.

## Description

The base `Resource` for every audio effect. In the editor, an audio effect can be added to the current bus layout through the Audio panel. At run-time, it is also possible to manipulate audio effects through `AudioServer.add_bus_effect()`, `AudioServer.remove_bus_effect()`, and `AudioServer.get_bus_effect()`.

When applied on a bus, an audio effect creates a corresponding `AudioEffectInstance`. The instance is directly responsible for manipulating sound, based on the original audio effect's properties.

## Method Descriptions

`AudioEffectInstance` **\_instantiate**() `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `required (This method is required to be overridden when extending its base class.)`

Override this method to customize the `AudioEffectInstance` created when this effect is applied on a bus in the editor's Audio panel, or through `AudioServer.add_bus_effect()`.

    extends AudioEffect

    @export var strength = 4.0

    func _instantiate():
        var effect = CustomAudioEffectInstance.new()
        effect.base = self

        return effect

**Note:** It is recommended to keep a reference to the original **AudioEffect** in the new instance. Depending on the implementation this allows the effect instance to listen for changes at run-time and be modified accordingly.
