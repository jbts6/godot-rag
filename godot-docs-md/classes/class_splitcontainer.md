# SplitContainer

**Inherits:** `Container` **<** `Control` **<** `CanvasItem` **<** `Node` **<** `Object`

**Inherited By:** `HSplitContainer`, `VSplitContainer`

A container that arranges child controls horizontally or vertically and provides grabbers for adjusting the split ratios between them.

## Description

A container that arranges child controls horizontally or vertically and creates grabbers between them. The grabbers can be dragged around to change the size relations between the child controls.

## Theme Properties

## Signals

**drag_ended**()

Emitted when the user ends dragging.

**drag_started**()

Emitted when the user starts dragging.

**dragged**(offset: `int`)

Emitted when any dragger is dragged by user.

## Enumerations

enum **DraggerVisibility**:

`DraggerVisibility` **DRAGGER_VISIBLE** = `0`

The split dragger icon is always visible when `autohide` is `false`, otherwise visible only when the cursor hovers it.

The size of the grabber icon determines the minimum `separation`.

The dragger icon is automatically hidden if the length of the grabber icon is longer than the split bar.

`DraggerVisibility` **DRAGGER_HIDDEN** = `1`

The split dragger icon is never visible regardless of the value of `autohide`.

The size of the grabber icon determines the minimum `separation`.

`DraggerVisibility` **DRAGGER_HIDDEN_COLLAPSED** = `2`

The split dragger icon is not visible, and the split bar is collapsed to zero thickness.

## Property Descriptions

`bool` **collapsed** = `false`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_collapsed**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **is_collapsed**()

If `true`, the draggers will be disabled and the children will be sized as if all `split_offsets` were `0`.

`bool` **drag_area_highlight_in_editor** = `false`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_drag_area_highlight_in_editor**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **is_drag_area_highlight_in_editor_enabled**()

Highlights the drag area `Rect2` so you can see where it is during development. The drag area is gold if `dragging_enabled` is `true`, and red if `false`.

`int` **drag_area_margin_begin** = `0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_drag_area_margin_begin**(value: `int`)
- `int` **get_drag_area_margin_begin**()

Reduces the size of the drag area and split bar `split_bar_background` at the beginning of the container.

`int` **drag_area_margin_end** = `0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_drag_area_margin_end**(value: `int`)
- `int` **get_drag_area_margin_end**()

Reduces the size of the drag area and split bar `split_bar_background` at the end of the container.

`int` **drag_area_offset** = `0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_drag_area_offset**(value: `int`)
- `int` **get_drag_area_offset**()

Shifts the drag area in the axis of the container to prevent the drag area from overlapping the `ScrollBar` or other selectable `Control` of a child node.

`bool` **drag_nested_intersections** = `false`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_drag_nested_intersections**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **is_dragging_nested_intersections**()

Adds extra draggers at the intersection of the draggers of two SplitContainers to allow dragging both at once. This must be set to `true` for both SplitContainers, and one needs to be a descendant of the other. They also must be orthogonal (their `vertical` are different) and the descendant must be next to at least one of the ancestor's draggers (within `minimum_grab_thickness`).

`DraggerVisibility` **dragger_visibility** = `0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_dragger_visibility**(value: `DraggerVisibility`)
- `DraggerVisibility` **get_dragger_visibility**()

Determines the dragger's visibility. This property does not determine whether dragging is enabled or not. Use `dragging_enabled` for that.

`bool` **dragging_enabled** = `true`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_dragging_enabled**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **is_dragging_enabled**()

Enables or disables split dragging.

`int` **split_offset** = `0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_split_offset**(value: `int`)
- `int` **get_split_offset**()

**Deprecated:** Use `split_offsets` instead. The first element of the array is the split offset between the first two children.

The first element of `split_offsets`.

`PackedInt32Array` **split_offsets** = `PackedInt32Array(0)`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_split_offsets**(value: `PackedInt32Array`)
- `PackedInt32Array` **get_split_offsets**()

Offsets for each dragger in pixels. Each one is the offset of the split between the `Control` nodes before and after the dragger, with `0` being the default position. The default position is based on the `Control` nodes expand flags and minimum sizes. See `Control.size_flags_horizontal`, `Control.size_flags_vertical`, and `Control.size_flags_stretch_ratio`.

If none of the `Control` nodes before the dragger are expanded, the default position will be at the start of the **SplitContainer**. If none of the `Control` nodes after the dragger are expanded, the default position will be at the end of the **SplitContainer**. If the dragger is in between expanded `Control` nodes, the default position will be in the middle, based on the `Control.size_flags_stretch_ratio`s and minimum sizes.

**Note:** If the split offsets cause `Control` nodes to overlap, the first split will take priority when resolving the positions.

**Note:** The returned array is *copied* and any changes to it will not update the original property value. See `PackedInt32Array` for more details.

`bool` **touch_dragger_enabled** = `false`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_touch_dragger_enabled**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **is_touch_dragger_enabled**()

If `true`, a touch-friendly drag handle will be enabled for better usability on smaller screens. Unlike the standard grabber, this drag handle overlaps the **SplitContainer**'s children and does not affect their minimum separation. The standard grabber will no longer be drawn when this option is enabled.

`bool` **vertical** = `false`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_vertical**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **is_vertical**()

If `true`, the **SplitContainer** will arrange its children vertically, rather than horizontally.

Can't be changed when using `HSplitContainer` and `VSplitContainer`.

## Method Descriptions

`void (No return value.)` **clamp_split_offset**(priority_index: `int` = 0)

Clamps the `split_offsets` values to ensure they are within valid ranges and do not overlap with each other. When overlaps occur, this method prioritizes one split offset (at index `priority_index`) by clamping any overlapping split offsets to it.

`Control` **get_drag_area_control**()

**Deprecated:** Use the first element of `get_drag_area_controls()` instead.

Returns the drag area `Control`. For example, you can move a pre-configured button into the drag area `Control` so that it rides along with the split bar. Try setting the `Button` anchors to `center` prior to the `reparent()` call.

    $BarnacleButton.reparent($SplitContainer.get_drag_area_control())

**Note:** The drag area `Control` is drawn over the **SplitContainer**'s children, so `CanvasItem` draw objects called from the `Control` and children added to the `Control` will also appear over the **SplitContainer**'s children. Try setting `Control.mouse_filter` of custom children to `Control.MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE` to prevent blocking the mouse from dragging if desired.

**Warning:** This is a required internal node, removing and freeing it may cause a crash.

`Array`\[`Control`\] **get_drag_area_controls**()

Returns an `Array` of the drag area `Control`s. These are the interactable `Control` nodes between each child. For example, this can be used to add a pre-configured button to a drag area `Control` so that it rides along with the split bar. Try setting the `Button` anchors to `center` prior to the `Node.reparent()` call.

    $BarnacleButton.reparent($SplitContainer.get_drag_area_controls()[0])

**Note:** The drag area `Control`s are drawn over the **SplitContainer**'s children, so `CanvasItem` draw objects called from a drag area and children added to it will also appear over the **SplitContainer**'s children. Try setting `Control.mouse_filter` of custom children to `Control.MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE` to prevent blocking the mouse from dragging if desired.

**Warning:** These are required internal nodes, removing or freeing them may cause a crash.

## Theme Property Descriptions

`Color` **touch_dragger_color** = `Color(1, 1, 1, 0.3)`

The color of the touch dragger.

`Color` **touch_dragger_hover_color** = `Color(1, 1, 1, 0.6)`

The color of the touch dragger when hovered.

`Color` **touch_dragger_pressed_color** = `Color(1, 1, 1, 1)`

The color of the touch dragger when pressed.

`int` **autohide** = `1`

Boolean value. If `1` (`true`), the grabbers will hide automatically when they aren't under the cursor. If `0` (`false`), the grabbers are always visible. The `dragger_visibility` must be `DRAGGER_VISIBLE`.

`int` **minimum_grab_thickness** = `6`

The minimum thickness of the area users can click on to grab a split bar. This ensures that the split bar can still be dragged if `separation` or `h_grabber` / `v_grabber`'s size is too narrow to easily select.

`int` **separation** = `12`

The split bar thickness, i.e., the gap between each child of the container. This is overridden by the size of the grabber icon if `dragger_visibility` is set to `DRAGGER_VISIBLE`, or `DRAGGER_HIDDEN`, and `separation` is smaller than the size of the grabber icon in the same axis.

**Note:** To obtain `separation` values less than the size of the grabber icon, for example a `1 px` hairline, set `h_grabber` or `v_grabber` to a new `ImageTexture`, which effectively sets the grabber icon size to `0 px`.

`Texture2D` **grabber**

The icon used for the grabbers drawn in the separations. This is only used in `HSplitContainer` and `VSplitContainer`. For **SplitContainer**, see `h_grabber` and `v_grabber` instead.

`Texture2D` **h_grabber**

The icon used for the grabbers drawn in the separations when `vertical` is `false`.

`Texture2D` **h_touch_dragger**

The icon used for the drag handle when `touch_dragger_enabled` is `true` and `vertical` is `false`.

`Texture2D` **touch_dragger**

The icon used for the drag handle when `touch_dragger_enabled` is `true`. This is only used in `HSplitContainer` and `VSplitContainer`. For **SplitContainer**, see `h_touch_dragger` and `v_touch_dragger` instead.

`Texture2D` **v_grabber**

The icon used for the grabbers drawn in the separations when `vertical` is `true`.

`Texture2D` **v_touch_dragger**

The icon used for the drag handle when `touch_dragger_enabled` is `true` and `vertical` is `true`.

`StyleBox` **split_bar_background**

Determines the background of the split bar if its thickness is greater than zero.
