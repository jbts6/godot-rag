# ResourceImporterBitMap

**Inherits:** `ResourceImporter` **<** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

Imports a `BitMap` resource (2D array of boolean values).

## Description

`BitMap` resources are typically used as click masks in `TextureButton` and `TouchScreenButton`.

## Tutorials

## Property Descriptions

`int` **create_from** = `0`

The data source to use for generating the bitmap.

**Black & White:** Pixels whose HSV value is greater than the `threshold` will be considered as "enabled" (bit is `true`). If the pixel is lower than or equal to the threshold, it will be considered as "disabled" (bit is `false`).

**Alpha:** Pixels whose alpha value is greater than the `threshold` will be considered as "enabled" (bit is `true`). If the pixel is lower than or equal to the threshold, it will be considered as "disabled" (bit is `false`).

`float` **threshold** = `0.5`

The threshold to use to determine which bits should be considered enabled or disabled. See also `create_from`.
