# AudioEffectPhaser

**Inherits:** `AudioEffect` **<** `Resource` **<** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

Adds a phaser audio effect to an audio bus.

Creates several notch and peak filters that sweep across the spectrum.

## Description

A "phaser" effect creates a copy of the original audio that phase-rotates differently across the entire frequency spectrum, with the use of a series of all-pass filter stages (6 in this effect). This copy modulates with a low-frequency oscillator and combines with the original audio, resulting in peaks and troughs that sweep across the spectrum.

This effect can be used to create a "glassy" or "bubbly" sound.

## Property Descriptions

`float` **depth** = `1.0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_depth**(value: `float`)
- `float` **get_depth**()

Intensity of the effect. Value can range from 0.1 to 4.0.

`float` **feedback** = `0.7`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_feedback**(value: `float`)
- `float` **get_feedback**()

The volume ratio of the filtered audio that is fed back to the all-pass filters. The higher the value, the sharper and louder the peak filters created by the effect. Value can range from 0.1 to 0.9.

`float` **range_max_hz** = `1600.0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_range_max_hz**(value: `float`)
- `float` **get_range_max_hz**()

Determines the maximum frequency affected by the low-frequency oscillator modulations, in Hz. Value can range from 10 to 10000.

`float` **range_min_hz** = `440.0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_range_min_hz**(value: `float`)
- `float` **get_range_min_hz**()

Determines the minimum frequency affected by the low-frequency oscillator modulations, in Hz. Value can range from 10 to 10000.

`float` **rate_hz** = `0.5`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_rate_hz**(value: `float`)
- `float` **get_rate_hz**()

Adjusts the rate in Hz at which the effect sweeps up and down across the frequency range. Value can range from 0.01 to 20.
