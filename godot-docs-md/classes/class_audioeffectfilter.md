# AudioEffectFilter

**Inherits:** `AudioEffect` **<** `Resource` **<** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

**Inherited By:** `AudioEffectBandLimitFilter`, `AudioEffectBandPassFilter`, `AudioEffectHighPassFilter`, `AudioEffectHighShelfFilter`, `AudioEffectLowPassFilter`, `AudioEffectLowShelfFilter`, `AudioEffectNotchFilter`

Base class for filters. Use effects that inherit this class instead of using it directly.

## Description

A "filter" controls the gain of frequencies, using `cutoff_hz` as a frequency threshold. Filters can help to give room for each sound, and create interesting effects.

There are different types of filter that inherit this class:

Shelf filters: `AudioEffectLowShelfFilter` and `AudioEffectHighShelfFilter`

Band-pass and notch filters: `AudioEffectBandPassFilter`, `AudioEffectBandLimitFilter`, and `AudioEffectNotchFilter`

Low/high-pass filters: `AudioEffectLowPassFilter` and `AudioEffectHighPassFilter`

## Enumerations

enum **FilterDB**:

`FilterDB` **FILTER_6DB** = `0`

Cutting off at 6 dB per octave. One octave is twice the frequency above `cutoff_hz`, or half the frequency below `cutoff_hz`.

`FilterDB` **FILTER_12DB** = `1`

Cutting off at 12 dB per octave. One octave is twice the frequency above `cutoff_hz`, or half the frequency below `cutoff_hz`.

`FilterDB` **FILTER_18DB** = `2`

Cutting off at 18 dB per octave. One octave is twice the frequency above `cutoff_hz`, or half the frequency below `cutoff_hz`.

`FilterDB` **FILTER_24DB** = `3`

Cutting off at 24 dB per octave. One octave is twice the frequency above `cutoff_hz`, or half the frequency below `cutoff_hz`.

## Property Descriptions

`float` **cutoff_hz** = `2000.0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_cutoff**(value: `float`)
- `float` **get_cutoff**()

Frequency threshold for the filter, in Hz. Value can range from 1 to 20500.

`FilterDB` **db** = `0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_db**(value: `FilterDB`)
- `FilterDB` **get_db**()

Steepness of the cutoff curve in dB per octave (twice the frequency above `cutoff_hz`, or half the frequency below `cutoff_hz`), also known as the "order" of the filter. Higher orders have a more aggressive cutoff.

`float` **gain** = `1.0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_gain**(value: `float`)
- `float` **get_gain**()

Gain of the frequencies affected by the filter. This property is only available for `AudioEffectLowShelfFilter` and `AudioEffectHighShelfFilter`. Value can range from 0 to 4.

`float` **resonance** = `0.5`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_resonance**(value: `float`)
- `float` **get_resonance**()

Gain at or directly next to the `cutoff_hz` frequency threshold. Value can range from 0 to 1.

Its exact behavior depends on the selected filter type:

- For shelf filters, it accentuates or masks the order by increasing frequencies right next to the `cutoff_hz` frequency and decreasing frequencies on the opposite side.
- For the band-pass and notch filters, it widens or narrows the filter at the `cutoff_hz` frequency threshold.
- For low/high-pass filters, it increases or decreases frequencies at the `cutoff_hz` frequency threshold.
