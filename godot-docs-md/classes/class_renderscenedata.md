# RenderSceneData

**Inherits:** `Object`

**Inherited By:** `RenderSceneDataExtension`, `RenderSceneDataRD`

Abstract render data object, holds scene data related to rendering a single frame of a viewport.

## Description

Abstract scene data object, exists for the duration of rendering a single viewport. See also `RenderSceneDataRD`, `RenderData`, and `RenderDataRD`.

**Note:** This is an internal rendering server object. Do not instantiate this class from a script.

## Method Descriptions

`Projection` **get_cam_projection**() `const`

Returns the camera projection used to render this frame.

**Note:** If more than one view is rendered, this will return a combined projection.

`Transform3D` **get_cam_transform**() `const`

Returns the camera transform used to render this frame.

**Note:** If more than one view is rendered, this will return a centered transform.

`RID` **get_uniform_buffer**() `const`

Return the `RID` of the uniform buffer containing the scene data as a UBO.

`int` **get_view_count**() `const`

Returns the number of views being rendered.

`Vector3` **get_view_eye_offset**(view: `int`) `const`

Returns the eye offset per view used to render this frame. This is the offset between our camera transform and the eye transform.

`Projection` **get_view_projection**(view: `int`) `const`

Returns the view projection per view used to render this frame.

**Note:** If a single view is rendered, this returns the camera projection. If more than one view is rendered, this will return a projection for the given view including the eye offset.
