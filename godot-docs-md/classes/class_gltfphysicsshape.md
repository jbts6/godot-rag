# GLTFPhysicsShape

**Inherits:** `Resource` **<** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

Represents a glTF physics shape.

## Description

Represents a physics shape as defined by the `OMI_physics_shape` or `OMI_collider` glTF extensions. This class is an intermediary between the glTF data and Godot's nodes, and it's abstracted in a way that allows adding support for different glTF physics extensions in the future.

## Property Descriptions

`float` **height** = `2.0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_height**(value: `float`)
- `float` **get_height**()

The height of the shape, in meters. This is only used when the shape type is `"capsule"` or `"cylinder"`. This value should not be negative, and for `"capsule"` it should be at least twice the radius.

`ImporterMesh` **importer_mesh**

- `void (No return value.)` **set_importer_mesh**(value: `ImporterMesh`)
- `ImporterMesh` **get_importer_mesh**()

The `ImporterMesh` resource of the shape. This is only used when the shape type is `"hull"` (convex hull) or `"trimesh"` (concave trimesh).

`bool` **is_trigger** = `false`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_is_trigger**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **get_is_trigger**()

If `true`, indicates that this shape is a trigger. For Godot, this means that the shape should be a child of an `Area3D` node.

This is the only variable not used in the `to_node()` method, it's intended to be used alongside when deciding where to add the generated node as a child.

`int` **mesh_index** = `-1`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_mesh_index**(value: `int`)
- `int` **get_mesh_index**()

The index of the shape's mesh in the glTF file. This is only used when the shape type is `"hull"` (convex hull) or `"trimesh"` (concave trimesh).

`float` **radius** = `0.5`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_radius**(value: `float`)
- `float` **get_radius**()

The radius of the shape, in meters. This is only used when the shape type is `"capsule"`, `"cylinder"`, or `"sphere"`. This value should not be negative.

`String` **shape_type** = `""`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_shape_type**(value: `String`)
- `String` **get_shape_type**()

The type of shape this shape represents. Valid values are `"box"`, `"capsule"`, `"cylinder"`, `"sphere"`, `"hull"`, and `"trimesh"`.

`Vector3` **size** = `Vector3(1, 1, 1)`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_size**(value: `Vector3`)
- `Vector3` **get_size**()

The size of the shape, in meters. This is only used when the shape type is `"box"`, and it represents the `"diameter"` of the box. This value should not be negative.

## Method Descriptions

`GLTFPhysicsShape` **from_dictionary**(dictionary: `Dictionary`) `static (This method doesn't need an instance to be called, so it can be called directly using the class name.)`

Creates a new GLTFPhysicsShape instance by parsing the given `Dictionary`.

`GLTFPhysicsShape` **from_node**(shape_node: `CollisionShape3D`) `static (This method doesn't need an instance to be called, so it can be called directly using the class name.)`

Creates a new GLTFPhysicsShape instance from the given Godot `CollisionShape3D` node.

`GLTFPhysicsShape` **from_resource**(shape_resource: `Shape3D`) `static (This method doesn't need an instance to be called, so it can be called directly using the class name.)`

Creates a new GLTFPhysicsShape instance from the given Godot `Shape3D` resource.

`Dictionary` **to_dictionary**() `const`

Serializes this GLTFPhysicsShape instance into a `Dictionary` in the format defined by `OMI_physics_shape`.

`CollisionShape3D` **to_node**(cache_shapes: `bool` = false)

Converts this GLTFPhysicsShape instance into a Godot `CollisionShape3D` node.

`Shape3D` **to_resource**(cache_shapes: `bool` = false)

Converts this GLTFPhysicsShape instance into a Godot `Shape3D` resource.
