# float

A built-in type for floating-point numbers.

## Description

The **float** built-in type is a 64-bit double-precision floating-point number, equivalent to `double` in C++. This type has 14 reliable decimal digits of precision. The maximum value of **float** is approximately `1.79769e308`, and the minimum is approximately `-1.79769e308`.

Many methods and properties in the engine use 32-bit single-precision floating-point numbers instead, equivalent to `float` in C++, which have 6 reliable decimal digits of precision. For data structures such as `Vector2` and `Vector3`, Godot uses 32-bit floating-point numbers by default, but it can be changed to use 64-bit doubles if Godot is compiled with the `precision=double` option.

Math done using the **float** type is not guaranteed to be exact and will often result in small errors. You should usually use the `@GlobalScope.is_equal_approx()` and `@GlobalScope.is_zero_approx()` methods instead of `==` to compare **float** values for equality.

**Note:** In a boolean context, a **float** will evaluate to `false` if it's exactly equal to `0.0`, and to `true` otherwise.

## Constructor Descriptions

`float` **float**()

Constructs a default-initialized **float** set to `0.0`.

`float` **float**(from: `float`)

Constructs a **float** as a copy of the given **float**.

`float` **float**(from: `String`)

Converts a `String` to a **float**, following the same rules as `String.to_float()`.

`float` **float**(from: `bool`)

Cast a `bool` value to a floating-point value, `float(true)` will be equal to 1.0 and `float(false)` will be equal to 0.0.

`float` **float**(from: `int`)

Cast an `int` value to a floating-point value, `float(1)` will be equal to `1.0`.

## Operator Descriptions

`bool` **operator !=**(right: `float`)

Returns `true` if two floats are different from each other.

**Note:** `@GDScript.NAN` doesn't behave the same as other numbers. Therefore, the results from this operator may not be accurate if NaNs are included.

`bool` **operator !=**(right: `int`)

Returns `true` if the integer has different value than the float.

`Color` **operator***(right: `Color`)

Multiplies each component of the `Color`, including the alpha, by the given **float**.

    print(1.5 * Color(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)) # Prints (0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 1.5)

`Quaternion` **operator***(right: `Quaternion`)

Multiplies each component of the `Quaternion` by the given **float**. This operation is not meaningful on its own, but it can be used as a part of a larger expression.

`Vector2` **operator***(right: `Vector2`)

Multiplies each component of the `Vector2` by the given **float**.

    print(2.5 * Vector2(1, 3)) # Prints (2.5, 7.5)

`Vector2` **operator***(right: `Vector2i`)

Multiplies each component of the `Vector2i` by the given **float**. Returns a `Vector2`.

    print(0.9 * Vector2i(10, 15)) # Prints (9.0, 13.5)

`Vector3` **operator***(right: `Vector3`)

Multiplies each component of the `Vector3` by the given **float**.

`Vector3` **operator***(right: `Vector3i`)

Multiplies each component of the `Vector3i` by the given **float**. Returns a `Vector3`.

    print(0.9 * Vector3i(10, 15, 20)) # Prints (9.0, 13.5, 18.0)

`Vector4` **operator***(right: `Vector4`)

Multiplies each component of the `Vector4` by the given **float**.

`Vector4` **operator***(right: `Vector4i`)

Multiplies each component of the `Vector4i` by the given **float**. Returns a `Vector4`.

    print(0.9 * Vector4i(10, 15, 20, -10)) # Prints (9.0, 13.5, 18.0, -9.0)

`float` **operator***(right: `float`)

Multiplies two **float**s.

`float` **operator***(right: `int`)

Multiplies a **float** and an `int`. The result is a **float**.

`float` **operator****(right: `float`)

Raises a **float** to a power of a **float**.

    print(39.0625**0.25) # 2.5

`float` **operator****(right: `int`)

Raises a **float** to a power of an `int`. The result is a **float**.

    print(0.9**3) # 0.729

`float` **operator +**(right: `float`)

Adds two floats.

`float` **operator +**(right: `int`)

Adds a **float** and an `int`. The result is a **float**.

`float` **operator -**(right: `float`)

Subtracts a float from a float.

`float` **operator -**(right: `int`)

Subtracts an `int` from a **float**. The result is a **float**.

`float` **operator /**(right: `float`)

Divides two floats.

`float` **operator /**(right: `int`)

Divides a **float** by an `int`. The result is a **float**.

`bool` **operator <**(right: `float`)

Returns `true` if the left float is less than the right one.

**Note:** `@GDScript.NAN` doesn't behave the same as other numbers. Therefore, the results from this operator may not be accurate if NaNs are included.

`bool` **operator <**(right: `int`)

Returns `true` if this **float** is less than the given `int`.

`bool` **operator <=**(right: `float`)

Returns `true` if the left float is less than or equal to the right one.

**Note:** `@GDScript.NAN` doesn't behave the same as other numbers. Therefore, the results from this operator may not be accurate if NaNs are included.

`bool` **operator <=**(right: `int`)

Returns `true` if this **float** is less than or equal to the given `int`.

`bool` **operator ==**(right: `float`)

Returns `true` if both floats are exactly equal.

**Note:** Due to floating-point precision errors, consider using `@GlobalScope.is_equal_approx()` or `@GlobalScope.is_zero_approx()` instead, which are more reliable.

**Note:** `@GDScript.NAN` doesn't behave the same as other numbers. Therefore, the results from this operator may not be accurate if NaNs are included.

`bool` **operator ==**(right: `int`)

Returns `true` if the **float** and the given `int` are equal.

`bool` **operator \>**(right: `float`)

Returns `true` if the left float is greater than the right one.

**Note:** `@GDScript.NAN` doesn't behave the same as other numbers. Therefore, the results from this operator may not be accurate if NaNs are included.

`bool` **operator \>=**(right: `float`)

`bool` **operator \>=**(right: `int`)

Returns `true` if this **float** is greater than or equal to the given `int`.

`float` **operator unary+**()

Returns the same value as if the `+` was not there. Unary `+` does nothing, but sometimes it can make your code more readable.

`float` **operator unary-**()

Returns the negative value of the **float**. If positive, turns the number negative. If negative, turns the number positive. With floats, the number zero can be either positive or negative.
