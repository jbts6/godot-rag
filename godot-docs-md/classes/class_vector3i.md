# Vector3i

A 3D vector using integer coordinates.

## Description

A 3-element structure that can be used to represent 3D grid coordinates or any other triplet of integers.

It uses integer coordinates and is therefore preferable to `Vector3` when exact precision is required. Note that the values are limited to 32 bits, and unlike `Vector3` this cannot be configured with an engine build option. Use `int` or `PackedInt64Array` if 64-bit values are needed.

**Note:** In a boolean context, a Vector3i will evaluate to `false` if it's equal to `Vector3i(0, 0, 0)`. Otherwise, a Vector3i will always evaluate to `true`.

## Constructor Descriptions

`Vector3i` **Vector3i**()

Constructs a default-initialized **Vector3i** with all components set to `0`.

`Vector3i` **Vector3i**(from: `Vector3i`)

Constructs a **Vector3i** as a copy of the given **Vector3i**.

`Vector3i` **Vector3i**(from: `Vector3`)

Constructs a new **Vector3i** from the given `Vector3` by truncating components' fractional parts (rounding towards zero). For a different behavior consider passing the result of `Vector3.ceil()`, `Vector3.floor()` or `Vector3.round()` to this constructor instead.

`Vector3i` **Vector3i**(x: `int`, y: `int`, z: `int`)

Returns a **Vector3i** with the given components.

## Method Descriptions

`Vector3i` **abs**() `const`

Returns a new vector with all components in absolute values (i.e. positive).

`Vector3i` **clamp**(min: `Vector3i`, max: `Vector3i`) `const`

Returns a new vector with all components clamped between the components of `min` and `max`, by running `@GlobalScope.clamp()` on each component.

`Vector3i` **clampi**(min: `int`, max: `int`) `const`

Returns a new vector with all components clamped between `min` and `max`, by running `@GlobalScope.clamp()` on each component.

`int` **distance_squared_to**(to: `Vector3i`) `const`

Returns the squared [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) between this vector and `to`.

This method runs faster than `distance_to()`, so prefer it if you need to compare vectors or need the squared distance for some formula.

`float` **distance_to**(to: `Vector3i`) `const`

Returns the [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) between this vector and `to`.

`float` **length**() `const`

Returns the length (magnitude) of this vector.

`int` **length_squared**() `const`

Returns the squared length (squared magnitude) of this vector.

This method runs faster than `length()`, so prefer it if you need to compare vectors or need the squared distance for some formula.

`Vector3i` **max**(with: `Vector3i`) `const`

Returns the component-wise maximum of this and `with`, equivalent to `Vector3i(maxi(x, with.x), maxi(y, with.y), maxi(z, with.z))`.

`int` **max_axis_index**() `const`

Returns the axis of the vector's highest value. See `AXIS_*` constants. If all components are equal, this method returns `AXIS_X`.

`Vector3i` **maxi**(with: `int`) `const`

Returns the component-wise maximum of this and `with`, equivalent to `Vector3i(maxi(x, with), maxi(y, with), maxi(z, with))`.

`Vector3i` **mini**(with: `int`) `const`

Returns the component-wise minimum of this and `with`, equivalent to `Vector3i(mini(x, with), mini(y, with), mini(z, with))`.

`Vector3i` **sign**() `const`

Returns a new vector with each component set to `1` if it's positive, `-1` if it's negative, and `0` if it's zero. The result is identical to calling `@GlobalScope.sign()` on each component.

`Vector3i` **snapped**(step: `Vector3i`) `const`

Returns a new vector with each component snapped to the closest multiple of the corresponding component in `step`.

`Vector3i` **snappedi**(step: `int`) `const`

Returns `true` if the vectors are not equal.

`Vector3i` **operator %**(right: `Vector3i`)

Gets the remainder of each component of the **Vector3i** with the components of the given **Vector3i**. This operation uses truncated division, which is often not desired as it does not work well with negative numbers. Consider using `@GlobalScope.posmod()` instead if you want to handle negative numbers.

    print(Vector3i(10, -20, 30) % Vector3i(7, 8, 9)) # Prints (3, -4, 3)

`Vector3i` **operator %**(right: `int`)

Gets the remainder of each component of the **Vector3i** with the given `int`. This operation uses truncated division, which is often not desired as it does not work well with negative numbers. Consider using `@GlobalScope.posmod()` instead if you want to handle negative numbers.

    print(Vector3i(10, -20, 30) % 7) # Prints (3, -6, 2)

`Vector3i` **operator***(right: `Vector3i`)

Multiplies each component of the **Vector3i** by the components of the given **Vector3i**.

    print(Vector3i(10, 20, 30) * Vector3i(3, 4, 5)) # Prints (30, 80, 150)

`Vector3` **operator***(right: `float`)

Multiplies each component of the **Vector3i** by the given `float`. Returns a `Vector3`.

Multiplies each component of the **Vector3i** by the given `int`.

`Vector3i` **operator +**(right: `Vector3i`)

Adds each component of the **Vector3i** by the components of the given **Vector3i**.

`Vector3i` **operator /**(right: `Vector3i`)

Divides each component of the **Vector3i** by the components of the given **Vector3i**.

    print(Vector3i(10, 20, 30) / Vector3i(2, 5, 3)) # Prints (5, 4, 10)

`Vector3` **operator /**(right: `float`)

Divides each component of the **Vector3i** by the given `float`. Returns a `Vector3`.

    print(Vector3i(1, 2, 3) / 2.5) # Prints (0.4, 0.8, 1.2)

`Vector3i` **operator /**(right: `int`)

Divides each component of the **Vector3i** by the given `int`.

`bool` **operator <**(right: `Vector3i`)

Compares two **Vector3i** vectors by first checking if the X value of the left vector is less than the X value of the `right` vector. If the X values are exactly equal, then it repeats this check with the Y values of the two vectors, and then with the Z values. This operator is useful for sorting vectors.

`bool` **operator <=**(right: `Vector3i`)

Compares two **Vector3i** vectors by first checking if the X value of the left vector is less than or equal to the X value of the `right` vector. If the X values are exactly equal, then it repeats this check with the Y values of the two vectors, and then with the Z values. This operator is useful for sorting vectors.

`bool` **operator ==**(right: `Vector3i`)

Returns `true` if the vectors are equal.

`bool` **operator \>**(right: `Vector3i`)

Compares two **Vector3i** vectors by first checking if the X value of the left vector is greater than the X value of the `right` vector. If the X values are exactly equal, then it repeats this check with the Y values of the two vectors, and then with the Z values. This operator is useful for sorting vectors.

`bool` **operator \>=**(right: `Vector3i`)

Compares two **Vector3i** vectors by first checking if the X value of the left vector is greater than or equal to the X value of the `right` vector. If the X values are exactly equal, then it repeats this check with the Y values of the two vectors, and then with the Z values. This operator is useful for sorting vectors.

`int` **operator \[\]**(index: `int`)

Access vector components using their `index`. `v[0]` is equivalent to `v.x`, `v[1]` is equivalent to `v.y`, and `v[2]` is equivalent to `v.z`.

`Vector3i` **operator unary+**()

Returns the same value as if the `+` was not there. Unary `+` does nothing, but sometimes it can make your code more readable.

`Vector3i` **operator unary-**()

Returns the negative value of the **Vector3i**. This is the same as writing `Vector3i(-v.x, -v.y, -v.z)`. This operation flips the direction of the vector while keeping the same magnitude.
