# StaticBody3D

**Inherits:** `PhysicsBody3D` **<** `CollisionObject3D` **<** `Node3D` **<** `Node` **<** `Object`

**Inherited By:** `AnimatableBody3D`

A 3D physics body that can't be moved by external forces. When moved manually, it doesn't affect other bodies in its path.

## Description

A static 3D physics body. It can't be moved by external forces or contacts, but can be moved manually by other means such as code, `AnimationMixer`s (with `AnimationMixer.callback_mode_process` set to `AnimationMixer.ANIMATION_CALLBACK_MODE_PROCESS_PHYSICS`), and `RemoteTransform3D`.

When **StaticBody3D** is moved, it is teleported to its new position without affecting other physics bodies in its path. If this is not desired, use `AnimatableBody3D` instead.

**StaticBody3D** is useful for completely static objects like floors and walls, as well as moving surfaces like conveyor belts and circular revolving platforms (by using `constant_linear_velocity` and `constant_angular_velocity`).

## Property Descriptions

`Vector3` **constant_angular_velocity** = `Vector3(0, 0, 0)`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_constant_angular_velocity**(value: `Vector3`)
- `Vector3` **get_constant_angular_velocity**()

The body's constant angular velocity. This does not rotate the body, but affects touching bodies, as if it were rotating.

`Vector3` **constant_linear_velocity** = `Vector3(0, 0, 0)`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_constant_linear_velocity**(value: `Vector3`)
- `Vector3` **get_constant_linear_velocity**()

The body's constant linear velocity. This does not move the body, but affects touching bodies, as if it were moving.

`PhysicsMaterial` **physics_material_override**

- `void (No return value.)` **set_physics_material_override**(value: `PhysicsMaterial`)
- `PhysicsMaterial` **get_physics_material_override**()

The physics material override for the body.

If a material is assigned to this property, it will be used instead of any other physics material, such as an inherited one.
