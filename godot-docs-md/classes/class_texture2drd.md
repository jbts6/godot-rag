# Texture2DRD

**Inherits:** `Texture2D` **<** `Texture` **<** `Resource` **<** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

Texture for 2D that is bound to a texture created on the `RenderingDevice`.

## Description

This texture class allows you to use a 2D texture created directly on the `RenderingDevice` as a texture for materials, meshes, etc.

**Note:** **Texture2DRD** is intended for low-level usage with `RenderingDevice`. For most use cases, use `Texture2D` instead.
