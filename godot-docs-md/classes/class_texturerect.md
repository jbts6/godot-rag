# TextureRect

**Inherits:** `Control` **<** `CanvasItem` **<** `Node` **<** `Object`

A control that displays a texture.

## Description

A control that displays a texture, for example an icon inside a GUI. The texture's placement can be controlled with the `stretch_mode` property. It can scale, tile, or stay centered inside its bounding rectangle.

## Enumerations

enum **ExpandMode**:

`ExpandMode` **EXPAND_KEEP_SIZE** = `0`

The minimum size will be equal to texture size, i.e. **TextureRect** can't be smaller than the texture.

`ExpandMode` **EXPAND_IGNORE_SIZE** = `1`

The size of the texture won't be considered for minimum size calculation, so the **TextureRect** can be shrunk down past the texture size.

`ExpandMode` **EXPAND_FIT_WIDTH** = `2`

The height of the texture will be ignored. Minimum width will be equal to the current height. Useful for horizontal layouts, e.g. inside `HBoxContainer`.

`ExpandMode` **EXPAND_FIT_WIDTH_PROPORTIONAL** = `3`

Same as `EXPAND_FIT_WIDTH`, but keeps texture's aspect ratio.

`ExpandMode` **EXPAND_FIT_HEIGHT** = `4`

The width of the texture will be ignored. Minimum height will be equal to the current width. Useful for vertical layouts, e.g. inside `VBoxContainer`.

`ExpandMode` **EXPAND_FIT_HEIGHT_PROPORTIONAL** = `5`

Same as `EXPAND_FIT_HEIGHT`, but keeps texture's aspect ratio.

enum **StretchMode**:

`StretchMode` **STRETCH_SCALE** = `0`

Scale to fit the node's bounding rectangle.

`StretchMode` **STRETCH_TILE** = `1`

Tile inside the node's bounding rectangle.

**Note:** `STRETCH_TILE` mode is not supported for `texture` set to an `AtlasTexture` with non-zero `AtlasTexture.margin`.

`StretchMode` **STRETCH_KEEP** = `2`

The texture keeps its original size and stays in the bounding rectangle's top-left corner.

`StretchMode` **STRETCH_KEEP_CENTERED** = `3`

The texture keeps its original size and stays centered in the node's bounding rectangle.

`StretchMode` **STRETCH_KEEP_ASPECT** = `4`

Scale the texture to fit the node's bounding rectangle, but maintain the texture's aspect ratio.

`StretchMode` **STRETCH_KEEP_ASPECT_CENTERED** = `5`

Scale the texture to fit the node's bounding rectangle, center it and maintain its aspect ratio.

`StretchMode` **STRETCH_KEEP_ASPECT_COVERED** = `6`

Scale the texture so that the shorter side fits the bounding rectangle. The other side clips to the node's limits.

## Property Descriptions

`ExpandMode` **expand_mode** = `0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_expand_mode**(value: `ExpandMode`)
- `ExpandMode` **get_expand_mode**()

**Experimental:** Using `EXPAND_FIT_WIDTH`, `EXPAND_FIT_WIDTH_PROPORTIONAL`, `EXPAND_FIT_HEIGHT`, or `EXPAND_FIT_HEIGHT_PROPORTIONAL` may result in unstable behavior in some `Container` controls. This behavior may be re-evaluated and changed in the future.

Defines how minimum size is determined based on the texture's size.

`bool` **flip_h** = `false`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_flip_h**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **is_flipped_h**()

If `true`, texture is flipped horizontally.

`bool` **flip_v** = `false`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_flip_v**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **is_flipped_v**()

If `true`, texture is flipped vertically.

`StretchMode` **stretch_mode** = `0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_stretch_mode**(value: `StretchMode`)
- `StretchMode` **get_stretch_mode**()

Controls the texture's behavior when resizing the node's bounding rectangle.

`Texture2D` **texture**

- `void (No return value.)` **set_texture**(value: `Texture2D`)
- `Texture2D` **get_texture**()

The node's `Texture2D` resource.
