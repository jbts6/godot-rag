## Property Descriptions

`Color` **color** = `Color(1, 1, 1, 1)`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_color**(value: `Color`)
- `Color` **get_color**()

The `Color` of the light in linear space. Defaults to white. A black color causes the light to have no effect.

This value is linear to match glTF, but will be converted to nonlinear sRGB when creating a Godot `Light3D` node upon import, or converted to linear when exporting a Godot `Light3D` to glTF.

`float` **inner_cone_angle** = `0.0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_inner_cone_angle**(value: `float`)
- `float` **get_inner_cone_angle**()

The inner angle of the cone in a spotlight. Must be less than or equal to the outer cone angle.

Within this angle, the light is at full brightness. Between the inner and outer cone angles, there is a transition from full brightness to zero brightness. When creating a Godot `SpotLight3D`, the ratio between the inner and outer cone angles is used to calculate the attenuation of the light.

`float` **intensity** = `1.0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_intensity**(value: `float`)
- `float` **get_intensity**()

The intensity of the light. This is expressed in candelas (lumens per steradian) for point and spot lights, and lux (lumens per m²) for directional lights. When creating a Godot light, this value is converted to a unitless multiplier.

`String` **light_type** = `""`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_light_type**(value: `String`)
- `String` **get_light_type**()

The type of the light. The values accepted by Godot are "point", "spot", and "directional", which correspond to Godot's `OmniLight3D`, `SpotLight3D`, and `DirectionalLight3D` respectively.

`float` **outer_cone_angle** = `0.7853982`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_outer_cone_angle**(value: `float`)
- `float` **get_outer_cone_angle**()

The outer angle of the cone in a spotlight. Must be greater than or equal to the inner angle.

At this angle, the light drops off to zero brightness. Between the inner and outer cone angles, there is a transition from full brightness to zero brightness. If this angle is a half turn, then the spotlight emits in all directions. When creating a Godot `SpotLight3D`, the outer cone angle is used as the angle of the spotlight.

`float` **range** = `inf`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_range**(value: `float`)
- `float` **get_range**()

The range of the light, beyond which the light has no effect. glTF lights with no range defined behave like physical lights (which have infinite range). When creating a Godot light, the range is clamped to `4096.0`.

## Method Descriptions

`GLTFLight` **from_dictionary**(dictionary: `Dictionary`) `static (This method doesn't need an instance to be called, so it can be called directly using the class name.)`

Creates a new GLTFLight instance by parsing the given `Dictionary`.

`GLTFLight` **from_node**(light_node: `Light3D`) `static (This method doesn't need an instance to be called, so it can be called directly using the class name.)`

Create a new GLTFLight instance from the given Godot `Light3D` node.
