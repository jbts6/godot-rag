# CollisionShape3D

**Inherits:** `Node3D` **<** `Node` **<** `Object`

A node that provides a `Shape3D` to a `CollisionObject3D` parent.

## Description

A node that provides a `Shape3D` to a `CollisionObject3D` parent and allows it to be edited. This can give a detection shape to an `Area3D` or turn a `PhysicsBody3D` into a solid object.

**Warning:** A non-uniformly scaled **CollisionShape3D** will likely not behave as expected. Make sure to keep its scale the same on all axes and adjust its `shape` resource instead.

## Property Descriptions

`Color` **debug_color** = `Color(0, 0, 0, 0)`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_debug_color**(value: `Color`)
- `Color` **get_debug_color**()

The collision shape color that is displayed in the editor, or in the running project if **Debug \> Visible Collision Shapes** is checked at the top of the editor.

**Note:** The default value is `ProjectSettings.debug/shapes/collision/shape_color`. The `Color(0, 0, 0, 0)` value documented here is a placeholder, and not the actual default debug color.

`bool` **debug_fill** = `true`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_enable_debug_fill**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **get_enable_debug_fill**()

If `true`, when the shape is displayed, it will show a solid fill color in addition to its wireframe.

`bool` **disabled** = `false`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_disabled**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **is_disabled**()

A disabled collision shape has no effect in the world. This property should be changed with `Object.set_deferred()`.

`Shape3D` **shape**

- `void (No return value.)` **set_shape**(value: `Shape3D`)
- `Shape3D` **get_shape**()

The actual shape owned by this collision shape.

## Method Descriptions

`void (No return value.)` **make_convex_from_siblings**()

Sets the collision shape's shape to the addition of all its convexed `MeshInstance3D` siblings geometry.

`void (No return value.)` **resource_changed**(resource: `Resource`)

**Deprecated:** Use `Resource.changed` instead.

This method does nothing.
