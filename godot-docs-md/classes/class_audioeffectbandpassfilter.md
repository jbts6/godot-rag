# AudioEffectBandPassFilter

**Inherits:** `AudioEffectFilter` **<** `AudioEffect` **<** `Resource` **<** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

Adds a band-pass filter to an audio bus.

## Description

A "band-pass" filter allows the frequencies at `AudioEffectFilter.cutoff_hz` to pass unchanged, and attenuates frequencies outside the frequency threshold. It is the opposite of `AudioEffectBandLimitFilter` and `AudioEffectNotchFilter`.

This filter can be used to emulate sounds coming from weak speakers.
