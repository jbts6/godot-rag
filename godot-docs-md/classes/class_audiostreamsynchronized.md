# AudioStreamSynchronized

**Inherits:** `AudioStream` **<** `Resource` **<** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

Stream that can be fitted with sub-streams, which will be played in-sync.

## Description

This is a stream that can be fitted with sub-streams, which will be played in-sync. The streams begin at exactly the same time when play is pressed, and will end when the last of them ends. If one of the sub-streams loops, then playback will continue.

## Tutorials

- `Audio streams `

## Constants

**MAX_STREAMS** = `32`

Maximum amount of streams that can be synchronized.

## Property Descriptions

`int` **stream_count** = `0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_stream_count**(value: `int`)
- `int` **get_stream_count**()

Set the total amount of streams that will be played back synchronized.

## Method Descriptions

`AudioStream` **get_sync_stream**(stream_index: `int`) `const`

Get one of the synchronized streams, by index.

`float` **get_sync_stream_volume**(stream_index: `int`) `const`

Get the volume of one of the synchronized streams, by index.

`void (No return value.)` **set_sync_stream**(stream_index: `int`, audio_stream: `AudioStream`)

Set one of the synchronized streams, by index.

`void (No return value.)` **set_sync_stream_volume**(stream_index: `int`, volume_db: `float`)

Set the volume of one of the synchronized streams, by index.
