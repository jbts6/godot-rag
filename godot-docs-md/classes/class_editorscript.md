# EditorScript

**Inherits:** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

Base script that can be used to add extension functions to the editor.

## Description

Scripts extending this class and implementing its `_run()` method can be executed from the Script Editor's **File \> Run** menu option (or by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + X`) while the editor is running. This is useful for adding custom in-editor functionality to Godot. For more complex additions, consider using `EditorPlugin`s instead.

If a script extending this class also has a global class name, it will be included in the editor's command palette.

**Note:** Extending scripts need to have `tool` mode enabled.

**Example:** Running the following script prints "Hello from the Godot Editor!":

``` gdscript
@tool
extends EditorScript

func _run():
    print("Hello from the Godot Editor!")
```

``` csharp
using Godot;

[Tool]
public partial class HelloEditor : EditorScript
{
    public override void _Run()
    {
        GD.Print("Hello from the Godot Editor!");
    }
}
```

**Note:** EditorScript is `RefCounted`, meaning it is destroyed when nothing references it. This can cause errors during asynchronous operations if there are no references to the script.

## Method Descriptions

`void (No return value.)` **\_run**() `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `required (This method is required to be overridden when extending its base class.)`

This method is executed by the Editor when **File \> Run** is used.

`void (No return value.)` **add_root_node**(node: `Node`)

**Deprecated:** Use `EditorInterface.add_root_node()` instead.

Makes `node` root of the currently opened scene. Only works if the scene is empty. If the `node` is a scene instance, an inheriting scene will be created.

`EditorInterface` **get_editor_interface**() `const`

**Deprecated:** `EditorInterface` is a global singleton and can be accessed directly by its name.

Returns the `EditorInterface` singleton instance.

`Node` **get_scene**() `const`

**Deprecated:** Use `EditorInterface.get_edited_scene_root()` instead.

Returns the edited (current) scene's root `Node`. Equivalent of `EditorInterface.get_edited_scene_root()`.
