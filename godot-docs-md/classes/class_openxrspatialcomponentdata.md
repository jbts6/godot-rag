Object for storing OpenXR spatial entity component data.

## Description

Object for storing OpenXR spatial entity component data.

## Method Descriptions

`int` **\_get_component_type**() `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `const`

Return the component type for the component we store data for.

`int` **\_get_structure_data**(next: `int`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`

Return a pointer to the structure data that will be submitted along with the snapshot query. This pointer must remain valid as long as this object is instantiated.

`void (No return value.)` **\_set_capacity**(capacity: `int`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`

Sets the expected capacity as provided by the spatial entities query system. Buffers should be initialized with the correct storage.

`int` **get_component_type**() `const`

Gets this **OpenXRSpatialComponentData**'s `XrSpatialComponentTypeEXT`.

`void (No return value.)` **set_capacity**(capacity: `int`)

Sets the expected capacity as provided by the spatial entities query system. Buffers should be initialized with the correct storage.
