# StreamPeerUDS

**Inherits:** `StreamPeerSocket` **<** `StreamPeer` **<** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

A stream peer that handles UNIX Domain Socket (UDS) connections.

## Description

A stream peer that handles UNIX Domain Socket (UDS) connections. This object can be used to connect to UDS servers, or also is returned by a UDS server. Unix Domain Sockets provide inter-process communication on the same machine using the filesystem namespace.

**Note:** UNIX Domain Sockets are only available on UNIX-like systems (Linux, macOS, etc.) and are not supported on Windows.

## Method Descriptions

`Error` **bind**(path: `String`)

Opens the UDS socket, and binds it to the specified socket path.

This method is generally not needed, and only used to force the subsequent call to `connect_to_host()` to use the specified `path` as the source address.

`Error` **connect_to_host**(path: `String`)

Connects to the specified UNIX Domain Socket path. Returns `@GlobalScope.OK` on success.

`String` **get_connected_path**() `const`

Returns the socket path of this peer.
