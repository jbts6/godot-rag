Adds a high-pass filter to an audio bus.

## Description

A "high-pass" filter attenuates frequencies lower than `AudioEffectFilter.cutoff_hz` and allows higher frequencies to pass unchanged.

This filter can be used to remove "strength" from a sound, and give low-end space for basses and impact sounds.
