# GDExtensionManager

**Inherits:** `Object`

Provides access to GDExtension functionality.

## Description

The GDExtensionManager loads, initializes, and keeps track of all available `GDExtension` libraries in the project.

**Note:** Do not worry about GDExtension unless you know what you are doing.

## Tutorials

- `GDExtension overview `
- `GDExtension example in C++ `

## Signals

**extension_loaded**(extension: `GDExtension`)

Emitted after the editor has finished loading a new extension.

**Note:** This signal is only emitted in editor builds.

**extension_unloading**(extension: `GDExtension`)

Emitted before the editor starts unloading an extension.

**Note:** This signal is only emitted in editor builds.

**extensions_reloaded**()

Emitted after the editor has finished reloading one or more extensions.

## Enumerations

enum **LoadStatus**:

`LoadStatus` **LOAD_STATUS_OK** = `0`

The extension has loaded successfully.

`LoadStatus` **LOAD_STATUS_FAILED** = `1`

The extension has failed to load, possibly because it does not exist or has missing dependencies.

`LoadStatus` **LOAD_STATUS_ALREADY_LOADED** = `2`

The extension has already been loaded.

`LoadStatus` **LOAD_STATUS_NOT_LOADED** = `3`

The extension has not been loaded.

`LoadStatus` **LOAD_STATUS_NEEDS_RESTART** = `4`

The extension requires the application to restart to fully load.

## Method Descriptions

`GDExtension` **get_extension**(path: `String`)

Returns the `GDExtension` at the given file `path`, or `null` if it has not been loaded or does not exist.

`PackedStringArray` **get_loaded_extensions**() `const`

Returns the file paths of all currently loaded extensions.

`bool` **is_extension_loaded**(path: `String`) `const`

Returns `true` if the extension at the given file `path` has already been loaded successfully. See also `get_loaded_extensions()`.

`LoadStatus` **load_extension**(path: `String`)

Loads an extension by absolute file path. The `path` needs to point to a valid `GDExtension`. Returns `LOAD_STATUS_OK` if successful.

`LoadStatus` **load_extension_from_function**(path: `String`, init_func: `const GDExtensionInitializationFunction*`)

Loads the extension already in address space via the given path and initialization function. The `path` needs to be unique and start with `"libgodot://"`. Returns `LOAD_STATUS_OK` if successful.

`LoadStatus` **reload_extension**(path: `String`)

Reloads the extension at the given file path. The `path` needs to point to a valid `GDExtension`, otherwise this method may return either `LOAD_STATUS_NOT_LOADED` or `LOAD_STATUS_FAILED`.

**Note:** You can only reload extensions in the editor. In release builds, this method always fails and returns `LOAD_STATUS_FAILED`.

`LoadStatus` **unload_extension**(path: `String`)

Unloads an extension by file path. The `path` needs to point to an already loaded `GDExtension`, otherwise this method returns `LOAD_STATUS_NOT_LOADED`.
