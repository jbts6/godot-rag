# Rect2

A 2D axis-aligned bounding box using floating-point coordinates.

## Description

The **Rect2** built-in `Variant` type represents an axis-aligned rectangle in a 2D space. It is defined by its `position` and `size`, which are `Vector2`. It is frequently used for fast overlap tests (see `intersects()`). Although **Rect2** itself is axis-aligned, it can be combined with `Transform2D` to represent a rotated or skewed rectangle.

For integer coordinates, use `Rect2i`. The 3D equivalent to **Rect2** is `AABB`.

**Note:** Negative values for `size` are not supported. With negative size, most **Rect2** methods do not work correctly. Use `abs()` to get an equivalent **Rect2** with a non-negative size.

**Note:** In a boolean context, a **Rect2** evaluates to `false` if both `position` and `size` are zero (equal to `Vector2.ZERO`). Otherwise, it always evaluates to `true`.

## Property Descriptions

`Vector2` **end** = `Vector2(0, 0)`

The ending point. This is usually the bottom-right corner of the rectangle, and is equivalent to `position + size`. Setting this point affects the `size`.

`Vector2` **position** = `Vector2(0, 0)`

The origin point. This is usually the top-left corner of the rectangle.

`Vector2` **size** = `Vector2(0, 0)`

The rectangle's width and height, starting from `position`. Setting this value also affects the `end` point.

**Note:** It's recommended setting the width and height to non-negative values, as most methods in Godot assume that the `position` is the top-left corner, and the `end` is the bottom-right corner. To get an equivalent rectangle with non-negative size, use `abs()`.

## Constructor Descriptions

`Rect2` **Rect2**()

Constructs a **Rect2** with its `position` and `size` set to `Vector2.ZERO`.

`Rect2` **Rect2**(from: `Rect2`)

Constructs a **Rect2** as a copy of the given **Rect2**.

`Rect2` **Rect2**(from: `Rect2i`)

Constructs a **Rect2** from a `Rect2i`.

`Rect2` **Rect2**(position: `Vector2`, size: `Vector2`)

Constructs a **Rect2** by `position` and `size`.

`Rect2` **Rect2**(x: `float`, y: `float`, width: `float`, height: `float`)

Constructs a **Rect2** by setting its `position` to (`x`, `y`), and its `size` to (`width`, `height`).

## Method Descriptions

`Rect2` **abs**() `const`

Returns a **Rect2** equivalent to this rectangle, with its width and height modified to be non-negative values, and with its `position` being the top-left corner of the rectangle.

``` gdscript
var rect = Rect2(25, 25, -100, -50)
var absolute = rect.abs() # absolute is Rect2(-75, -25, 100, 50)
```

``` csharp
var rect = new Rect2(25, 25, -100, -50);
var absolute = rect.Abs(); // absolute is Rect2(-75, -25, 100, 50)
```

**Note:** It's recommended to use this method when `size` is negative, as most other methods in Godot assume that the `position` is the top-left corner, and the `end` is the bottom-right corner.

`bool` **encloses**(b: `Rect2`) `const`

Returns `true` if this rectangle *completely* encloses the `b` rectangle.

`Rect2` **expand**(to: `Vector2`) `const`

Returns a copy of this rectangle expanded to align the edges with the given `to` point, if necessary.

``` gdscript
var rect = Rect2(0, 0, 5, 2)

rect = rect.expand(Vector2(10, 0)) # rect is Rect2(0, 0, 10, 2)
rect = rect.expand(Vector2(-5, 5)) # rect is Rect2(-5, 0, 15, 5)
```

``` csharp
var rect = new Rect2(0, 0, 5, 2);

rect = rect.Expand(new Vector2(10, 0)); // rect is Rect2(0, 0, 10, 2)
rect = rect.Expand(new Vector2(-5, 5)); // rect is Rect2(-5, 0, 15, 5)
```

`float` **get_area**() `const`

Returns the rectangle's area. This is equivalent to `size.x * size.y`. See also `has_area()`.

`Vector2` **get_center**() `const`

Returns the center point of the rectangle. This is the same as `position + (size / 2.0)`.

`Vector2` **get_support**(direction: `Vector2`) `const`

Returns the vertex's position of this rect that's the farthest in the given direction. This point is commonly known as the support point in collision detection algorithms.

`Rect2` **grow**(amount: `float`) `const`

Returns a copy of this rectangle extended on all sides by the given `amount`. A negative `amount` shrinks the rectangle instead. See also `grow_individual()` and `grow_side()`.

``` gdscript
var a = Rect2(4, 4, 8, 8).grow(4) # a is Rect2(0, 0, 16, 16)
var b = Rect2(0, 0, 8, 4).grow(2) # b is Rect2(-2, -2, 12, 8)
```

``` csharp
var a = new Rect2(4, 4, 8, 8).Grow(4); // a is Rect2(0, 0, 16, 16)
var b = new Rect2(0, 0, 8, 4).Grow(2); // b is Rect2(-2, -2, 12, 8)
```

`Rect2` **grow_individual**(left: `float`, top: `float`, right: `float`, bottom: `float`) `const`

Returns a copy of this rectangle with its `left`, `top`, `right`, and `bottom` sides extended by the given amounts. Negative values shrink the sides, instead. See also `grow()` and `grow_side()`.

`Rect2` **grow_side**(side: `int`, amount: `float`) `const`

Returns a copy of this rectangle with its `side` extended by the given `amount` (see `Side` constants). A negative `amount` shrinks the rectangle, instead. See also `grow()` and `grow_individual()`.

`bool` **has_area**() `const`

Returns `true` if this rectangle has positive width and height. See also `get_area()`.

`bool` **has_point**(point: `Vector2`) `const`

Returns `true` if the rectangle contains the given `point`. By convention, points on the right and bottom edges are **not** included.

**Note:** This method is not reliable for **Rect2** with a *negative* `size`. Use `abs()` first to get a valid rectangle.

`Rect2` **intersection**(b: `Rect2`) `const`

Returns the intersection between this rectangle and `b`. If the rectangles do not intersect, returns an empty **Rect2**.

``` gdscript
var rect1 = Rect2(0, 0, 5, 10)
var rect2 = Rect2(2, 0, 8, 4)

var a = rect1.intersection(rect2) # a is Rect2(2, 0, 3, 4)
```

``` csharp
var rect1 = new Rect2(0, 0, 5, 10);
var rect2 = new Rect2(2, 0, 8, 4);

var a = rect1.Intersection(rect2); // a is Rect2(2, 0, 3, 4)
```

**Note:** If you only need to know whether two rectangles are overlapping, use `intersects()`, instead.

`bool` **intersects**(b: `Rect2`, include_borders: `bool` = false) `const`

Returns `true` if this rectangle overlaps with the `b` rectangle. The edges of both rectangles are excluded, unless `include_borders` is `true`.

`bool` **is_equal_approx**(rect: `Rect2`) `const`

Returns `true` if this rectangle and `rect` are approximately equal, by calling `Vector2.is_equal_approx()` on the `position` and the `size`.

`bool` **is_finite**() `const`

Returns `true` if this rectangle's values are finite, by calling `Vector2.is_finite()` on the `position` and the `size`.

`Rect2` **merge**(b: `Rect2`) `const`

Returns a **Rect2** that encloses both this rectangle and `b` around the edges. See also `encloses()`.

## Operator Descriptions

`bool` **operator !=**(right: `Rect2`)

Returns `true` if the `position` or `size` of both rectangles are not equal.

**Note:** Due to floating-point precision errors, consider using `is_equal_approx()` instead, which is more reliable.

`Rect2` **operator***(right: `Transform2D`)

Inversely transforms (multiplies) the **Rect2** by the given `Transform2D` transformation matrix, under the assumption that the transformation basis is orthonormal (i.e. rotation/reflection is fine, scaling/skew is not).

`rect * transform` is equivalent to `transform.inverse() * rect`. See `Transform2D.inverse()`.

For transforming by inverse of an affine transformation (e.g. with scaling) `transform.affine_inverse() * rect` can be used instead. See `Transform2D.affine_inverse()`.

`bool` **operator ==**(right: `Rect2`)

Returns `true` if both `position` and `size` of the rectangles are exactly equal, respectively.

**Note:** Due to floating-point precision errors, consider using `is_equal_approx()` instead, which is more reliable.
