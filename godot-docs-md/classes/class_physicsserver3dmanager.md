# PhysicsServer3DManager

**Inherits:** `Object`

A singleton for managing `PhysicsServer3D` implementations.

## Description

**PhysicsServer3DManager** is the API for registering `PhysicsServer3D` implementations and for setting the default implementation.

**Note:** It is not possible to switch physics servers at runtime. This class is only used on startup at the server initialization level, by Godot itself and possibly by GDExtensions.

## Method Descriptions

`void (No return value.)` **register_server**(name: `String`, create_callback: `Callable`)

Register a `PhysicsServer3D` implementation by passing a `name` and a `Callable` that returns a `PhysicsServer3D` object.

`void (No return value.)` **set_default_server**(name: `String`, priority: `int`)

Set the default `PhysicsServer3D` implementation to the one identified by `name`, if `priority` is greater than the priority of the current default implementation.
