# CheckBox

**Inherits:** `Button` **<** `BaseButton` **<** `Control` **<** `CanvasItem` **<** `Node` **<** `Object`

A button that represents a binary choice.

## Description

**CheckBox** allows the user to choose one of only two possible options. It's similar to `CheckButton` in functionality, but it has a different appearance. To follow established UX patterns, it's recommended to use **CheckBox** when toggling it has **no** immediate effect on something. For example, it could be used when toggling it will only do something once a confirmation button is pressed.

See also `BaseButton` which contains common properties and methods associated with this node.

When `BaseButton.button_group` specifies a `ButtonGroup`, **CheckBox** changes its appearance to that of a radio button and uses the various `radio_*` theme properties.
