**Inherits:** `Shape2D` **<** `Resource` **<** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

A 2D rectangle shape used for physics collision.

## Description

A 2D rectangle shape, intended for use in physics. Usually used to provide a shape for a `CollisionShape2D`.

**Performance:** **RectangleShape2D** is fast to check collisions against. It is faster than `CapsuleShape2D`, but slower than `CircleShape2D`.
