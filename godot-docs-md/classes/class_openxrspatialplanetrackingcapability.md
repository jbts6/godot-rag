# OpenXRSpatialPlaneTrackingCapability

**Experimental:** This class may be changed or removed in future versions.

**Inherits:** `OpenXRExtensionWrapper` **<** `Object`

Implementation for handling spatial entity plane tracking logic.

## Description

This class handles the OpenXR plane tracking spatial entity extension.

## Method Descriptions

`bool` **is_supported**()

Returns `true` if plane tracking is supported by the current device.

`OpenXRFutureResult` **start_entity_discovery**(spatial_context: `RID`, component_data: `Array`\[`OpenXRSpatialComponentData`\], next_snapshot_create: `OpenXRStructureBase` = null, next_snapshot_query: `OpenXRStructureBase` = null, user_callback: `Callable` = Callable())

Calls `OpenXRSpatialEntityExtension.discover_spatial_entities()` and `OpenXRSpatialEntityExtension.query_snapshot()` with the plane entities associated with `spatial_context`.

`component_data` are the `OpenXRSpatialComponentData`s to discover for this plane capability.

If `next_snapshot_create` is non-null, then pass this to the `next` parameter in `OpenXRSpatialEntityExtension.discover_spatial_entities()`.

If `next_snapshot_query` is non-null, then pass this to the `next` parameter in `OpenXRSpatialEntityExtension.query_snapshot()`.

`user_callback`, when non-null, is called with two parameters usually twice. The first parameter is the `RID` of the discovery snapshot and the second parameter is a boolean where `false` indicates the discovery snapshot is about to be processed, and `true` indicates the discovery snapshot has been processed and `component_data` has valid data. The second call is skipped if an error was encountered.

The returned `OpenXRFutureResult` is identical to the return from `OpenXRSpatialEntityExtension.discover_spatial_entities()`.
