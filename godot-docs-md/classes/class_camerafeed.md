# CameraFeed

**Inherits:** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

A camera feed gives you access to a single physical camera attached to your device.

## Description

A camera feed gives you access to a single physical camera attached to your device. When enabled, Godot will start capturing frames from the camera which can then be used. See also `CameraServer`.

**Note:** Many cameras will return YCbCr images which are split into two textures and need to be combined in a shader. Godot does this automatically for you if you set the environment to show the camera image in the background.

**Note:** This class is currently only implemented on Linux, Android, macOS, and iOS. On other platforms no **CameraFeed**s will be available. To get a **CameraFeed** on iOS, enable `EditorExportPlatformIOS.modules/camera`.

## Signals

**format_changed**()

Emitted when the format has changed.

**frame_changed**()

Emitted when a new frame is available.

## Enumerations

enum **FeedDataType**:

`FeedDataType` **FEED_NOIMAGE** = `0`

No image set for the feed.

`FeedDataType` **FEED_RGB** = `1`

Feed supplies RGB images.

`FeedDataType` **FEED_YCBCR** = `2`

Feed supplies YCbCr images that need to be converted to RGB.

`FeedDataType` **FEED_YCBCR_SEP** = `3`

Feed supplies separate Y and CbCr images that need to be combined and converted to RGB.

`FeedDataType` **FEED_EXTERNAL** = `4`

Feed supplies external image.

enum **FeedPosition**:

`FeedPosition` **FEED_UNSPECIFIED** = `0`

Unspecified position.

`FeedPosition` **FEED_FRONT** = `1`

Camera is mounted at the front of the device.

`FeedPosition` **FEED_BACK** = `2`

Camera is mounted at the back of the device.

## Property Descriptions

`bool` **feed_is_active** = `false`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_active**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **is_active**()

If `true`, the feed is active.

`Transform2D` **feed_transform** = `Transform2D(1, 0, 0, -1, 0, 1)`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_transform**(value: `Transform2D`)
- `Transform2D` **get_transform**()

The transform applied to the camera's image.

`Array` **formats** = `[]`

- `Array` **get_formats**()

Formats supported by the feed. Each entry is a `Dictionary` describing format parameters.

## Method Descriptions

`bool` **\_activate_feed**() `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`

Called when the camera feed is activated.

`void (No return value.)` **\_deactivate_feed**() `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`

Called when the camera feed is deactivated.

`Array` **\_get_formats**() `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `const`

Override this method to define supported formats of the camera feed.

`bool` **\_set_format**(index: `int`, parameters: `Dictionary`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`

Override this method to set the format of the camera feed.

`FeedDataType` **get_datatype**() `const`

Returns feed image data type.

`int` **get_id**() `const`

Returns the unique ID for this feed.

`String` **get_name**() `const`

Returns the camera's name.

`FeedPosition` **get_position**() `const`

Returns the position of camera on the device.

`int` **get_texture_tex_id**(feed_image_type: `FeedImage`)

Returns the texture backend ID (usable by some external libraries that need a handle to a texture to write data).

`void (No return value.)` **set_external**(width: `int`, height: `int`)

Sets the feed as external feed provided by another library.

`bool` **set_format**(index: `int`, parameters: `Dictionary`)

Sets the feed format parameters for the given `index` in the `formats` array. Returns `true` on success. By default, the YUYV encoded stream is transformed to `FEED_RGB`. The YUYV encoded stream output format can be changed by setting `parameters`'s `output` entry to one of the following:

- `"separate"` will result in `FEED_YCBCR_SEP`;
- `"grayscale"` will result in desaturated `FEED_RGB`;
- `"copy"` will result in `FEED_YCBCR`.

`void (No return value.)` **set_name**(name: `String`)

Sets the camera's name.

`void (No return value.)` **set_position**(position: `FeedPosition`)

Sets the position of this camera.

`void (No return value.)` **set_rgb_image**(rgb_image: `Image`)

Sets RGB image for this feed.

`void (No return value.)` **set_ycbcr_image**(ycbcr_image: `Image`)

Sets YCbCr image for this feed.

`void (No return value.)` **set_ycbcr_images**(y_image: `Image`, cbcr_image: `Image`)

Sets Y and CbCr images for this feed.
