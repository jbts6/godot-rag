# MeshInstance2D

**Inherits:** `Node2D` **<** `CanvasItem` **<** `Node` **<** `Object`

Node used for displaying a `Mesh` in 2D.

## Description

Node used for displaying a `Mesh` in 2D. This can be faster to render compared to displaying a `Sprite2D` node with large transparent areas, especially if the node takes up a lot of space on screen at high viewport resolutions. This is because using a mesh designed to fit the sprite's opaque areas will reduce GPU fill rate utilization (at the cost of increased vertex processing utilization).

When a `Mesh` has to be instantiated more than thousands of times close to each other, consider using a `MultiMesh` in a `MultiMeshInstance2D` instead.

A **MeshInstance2D** can be created from an existing `Sprite2D` via a tool in the editor toolbar. Select the `Sprite2D` node, then choose **Sprite2D \> Convert to MeshInstance2D** at the top of the 2D editor viewport.

## Tutorials

- `2D meshes `

## Signals

**texture_changed**()

Emitted when the `texture` is changed.

## Property Descriptions

`Mesh` **mesh**

- `void (No return value.)` **set_mesh**(value: `Mesh`)
- `Mesh` **get_mesh**()

The `Mesh` that will be drawn by the **MeshInstance2D**.

`Texture2D` **texture**

- `void (No return value.)` **set_texture**(value: `Texture2D`)
- `Texture2D` **get_texture**()

The `Texture2D` that will be used if using the default `CanvasItemMaterial`. Can be accessed as `TEXTURE` in CanvasItem shader.
