# Vector4

A 4D vector using floating-point coordinates.

## Description

A 4-element structure that can be used to represent 4D coordinates or any other quadruplet of numeric values.

It uses floating-point coordinates. By default, these floating-point values use 32-bit precision, unlike `float` which is always 64-bit. If double precision is needed, compile the engine with the option `precision=double`.

See `Vector4i` for its integer counterpart.

**Note:** In a boolean context, a Vector4 will evaluate to `false` if it's equal to `Vector4(0, 0, 0, 0)`. Otherwise, a Vector4 will always evaluate to `true`.

## Enumerations

Performs a cubic interpolation between this vector and `b` using `pre_a` and `post_b` as handles, and returns the result at position `weight`. `weight` is on the range of 0.0 to 1.0, representing the amount of interpolation.

`Vector4` **cubic_interpolate_in_time**(b: `Vector4`, pre_a: `Vector4`, post_b: `Vector4`, weight: `float`, b_t: `float`, pre_a_t: `float`, post_b_t: `float`) `const`

It can perform smoother interpolation than `cubic_interpolate()` by the time values.

`Vector4` **direction_to**(to: `Vector4`) `const`

`float` **distance_squared_to**(to: `Vector4`) `const`

Returns the squared [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) between this vector and `to`.

This method runs faster than `distance_to()`, so prefer it if you need to compare vectors or need the squared distance for some formula.

Returns a new vector with all components rounded down (towards negative infinity).

`Vector4` **inverse**() `const`

This method is faster than using `is_equal_approx()` with one value as a zero vector.

`float` **length**() `const`

Returns the length (magnitude) of this vector.

`float` **length_squared**() `const`

`Vector4` **lerp**(to: `Vector4`, weight: `float`) `const`

`Vector4` **minf**(with: `float`) `const`

Returns the component-wise minimum of this and `with`, equivalent to `Vector4(minf(x, with), minf(y, with), minf(z, with), minf(w, with))`.

`Vector4` **normalized**() `const`

Returns the result of scaling the vector to unit length. Equivalent to `v / v.length()`. Returns `(0, 0, 0, 0)` if `v.length() == 0`. See also `is_normalized()`.

**Note:** This function may return incorrect values if the input vector length is near zero.

`Vector4` **posmod**(mod: `float`) `const`

`Vector4` **snapped**(step: `Vector4`) `const`

Returns a new vector with each component snapped to the nearest multiple of the corresponding component in `step`. This can also be used to round the components to an arbitrary number of decimals.

## Operator Descriptions

`bool` **operator !=**(right: `Vector4`)

Returns `true` if the vectors are not equal.

**Note:** Due to floating-point precision errors, consider using `is_equal_approx()` instead, which is more reliable.

**Note:** Vectors with `@GDScript.NAN` elements don't behave the same as other vectors. Therefore, the results from this operator may not be accurate if NaNs are included.

`Vector4` **operator***(right: `Projection`)

Transforms (multiplies) the **Vector4** by the transpose of the given `Projection` matrix.

For transforming by inverse of a projection `projection.inverse() * vector` can be used instead. See `Projection.inverse()`.

Multiplies each component of the **Vector4** by the components of the given **Vector4**.

    print(Vector4(10, 20, 30, 40) * Vector4(3, 4, 5, 6)) # Prints (30.0, 80.0, 150.0, 240.0)

`Vector4` **operator***(right: `float`)

    print(Vector4(10, 20, 30, 40) / Vector4(2, 5, 3, 4)) # Prints (5.0, 4.0, 10.0, 10.0)

`Vector4` **operator /**(right: `float`)

`bool` **operator <**(right: `Vector4`)

Compares two **Vector4** vectors by first checking if the X value of the left vector is less than the X value of the `right` vector. If the X values are exactly equal, then it repeats this check with the Y values of the two vectors, Z values of the two vectors, and then with the W values. This operator is useful for sorting vectors.

**Note:** Vectors with `@GDScript.NAN` elements don't behave the same as other vectors. Therefore, the results from this operator may not be accurate if NaNs are included.

`bool` **operator <=**(right: `Vector4`)

Compares two **Vector4** vectors by first checking if the X value of the left vector is less than or equal to the X value of the `right` vector. If the X values are exactly equal, then it repeats this check with the Y values of the two vectors, Z values of the two vectors, and then with the W values. This operator is useful for sorting vectors.

**Note:** Vectors with `@GDScript.NAN` elements don't behave the same as other vectors. Therefore, the results from this operator may not be accurate if NaNs are included.

`bool` **operator ==**(right: `Vector4`)

Returns `true` if the vectors are exactly equal.

**Note:** Due to floating-point precision errors, consider using `is_equal_approx()` instead, which is more reliable.

**Note:** Vectors with `@GDScript.NAN` elements don't behave the same as other vectors. Therefore, the results from this operator may not be accurate if NaNs are included.

`bool` **operator \>**(right: `Vector4`)

Compares two **Vector4** vectors by first checking if the X value of the left vector is greater than the X value of the `right` vector. If the X values are exactly equal, then it repeats this check with the Y values of the two vectors, Z values of the two vectors, and then with the W values. This operator is useful for sorting vectors.

**Note:** Vectors with `@GDScript.NAN` elements don't behave the same as other vectors. Therefore, the results from this operator may not be accurate if NaNs are included.

`bool` **operator \>=**(right: `Vector4`)

Compares two **Vector4** vectors by first checking if the X value of the left vector is greater than or equal to the X value of the `right` vector. If the X values are exactly equal, then it repeats this check with the Y values of the two vectors, Z values of the two vectors, and then with the W values. This operator is useful for sorting vectors.

**Note:** Vectors with `@GDScript.NAN` elements don't behave the same as other vectors. Therefore, the results from this operator may not be accurate if NaNs are included.

`float` **operator \[\]**(index: `int`)

Access vector components using their `index`. `v[0]` is equivalent to `v.x`, `v[1]` is equivalent to `v.y`, `v[2]` is equivalent to `v.z`, and `v[3]` is equivalent to `v.w`.

`Vector4` **operator unary+**()

Returns the same value as if the `+` was not there. Unary `+` does nothing, but sometimes it can make your code more readable.

`Vector4` **operator unary-**()

Returns the negative value of the **Vector4**. This is the same as writing `Vector4(-v.x, -v.y, -v.z, -v.w)`. This operation flips the direction of the vector while keeping the same magnitude. With floats, the number zero can be either positive or negative.
