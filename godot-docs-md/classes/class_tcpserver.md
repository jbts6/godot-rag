# TCPServer

**Inherits:** `SocketServer` **<** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

A TCP server.

## Description

A TCP server. Listens to connections on a port and returns a `StreamPeerTCP` when it gets an incoming connection.

**Note:** When exporting to Android, make sure to enable the `INTERNET` permission in the Android export preset before exporting the project or using one-click deploy. Otherwise, network communication of any kind will be blocked by Android.

## Method Descriptions

`int` **get_local_port**() `const`

Returns the local port this server is listening to.

`Error` **listen**(port: `int`, bind_address: `String` = "*")

Listen on the `port` binding to `bind_address`.

If `bind_address` is set as `"*"` (default), the server will listen on all available addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6).

If `bind_address` is set as `"0.0.0.0"` (for IPv4) or `"::"` (for IPv6), the server will listen on all available addresses matching that IP type.

If `bind_address` is set to any valid address (e.g. `"192.168.1.101"`, `"::1"`, etc.), the server will only listen on the interface with that address (or fail if no interface with the given address exists).

`StreamPeerTCP` **take_connection**()

If a connection is available, returns a StreamPeerTCP with the connection.
