## Method Descriptions

`Variant` **get_additional_data**(extension_name: `StringName`)

Gets additional arbitrary data in this **GLTFAnimation** instance. This can be used to keep per-node state data in `GLTFDocumentExtension` classes, which is important because they are stateless.

The argument should be the `GLTFDocumentExtension` name (does not have to match the extension name in the glTF file), and the return value can be anything you set. If nothing was set, the return value is `null`.

`void (No return value.)` **set_additional_data**(extension_name: `StringName`, additional_data: `Variant`)

Sets additional arbitrary data in this **GLTFAnimation** instance. This can be used to keep per-node state data in `GLTFDocumentExtension` classes, which is important because they are stateless.

The first argument should be the `GLTFDocumentExtension` name (does not have to match the extension name in the glTF file), and the second argument can be anything you want.
