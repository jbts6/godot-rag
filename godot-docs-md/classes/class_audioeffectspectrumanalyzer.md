# AudioEffectSpectrumAnalyzer

**Inherits:** `AudioEffect` **<** `Resource` **<** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

Creates an `AudioEffectInstance` which performs frequency analysis and exposes results to be accessed in real-time.

## Description

Calculates a Fourier Transform of the audio signal. This effect does not alter the audio. Can be used for creating real-time audio visualizations, like a spectrogram.

This resource configures an `AudioEffectSpectrumAnalyzerInstance`, which performs the actual analysis at runtime. An instance should be obtained with `AudioServer.get_bus_effect_instance()` to make use of this effect.

## Enumerations

enum **FFTSize**:

`FFTSize` **FFT_SIZE_256** = `0`

Use a buffer of 256 samples for the Fast Fourier transform. Lowest latency, but least stable over time.

`FFTSize` **FFT_SIZE_512** = `1`

Use a buffer of 512 samples for the Fast Fourier transform. Low latency, but less stable over time.

`FFTSize` **FFT_SIZE_1024** = `2`

Use a buffer of 1024 samples for the Fast Fourier transform. This is a compromise between latency and stability over time.

`FFTSize` **FFT_SIZE_2048** = `3`

Use a buffer of 2048 samples for the Fast Fourier transform. High latency, but stable over time.

`FFTSize` **FFT_SIZE_4096** = `4`

Use a buffer of 4096 samples for the Fast Fourier transform. Highest latency, but most stable over time.

`FFTSize` **FFT_SIZE_MAX** = `5`

Represents the size of the `FFTSize` enum.

## Property Descriptions

`float` **buffer_length** = `2.0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_buffer_length**(value: `float`)
- `float` **get_buffer_length**()

The length of the buffer to keep, in seconds. Higher values keep data around for longer, but require more memory. Value can range from 0.1 to 4.

`FFTSize` **fft_size** = `2`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_fft_size**(value: `FFTSize`)
- `FFTSize` **get_fft_size**()

The size of the [Fast Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) buffer. Higher values smooth out the spectrum analysis over time, but have greater latency. The effects of this higher latency are especially noticeable with sudden amplitude changes.
