AudioStream that lets the user play custom streams at any time from code, simultaneously using a single player.

## Description

AudioStream that lets the user play custom streams at any time from code, simultaneously using a single player.

Playback control is done via the `AudioStreamPlaybackPolyphonic` instance set inside the player, which can be obtained via `AudioStreamPlayer.get_stream_playback()`, `AudioStreamPlayer2D.get_stream_playback()` or `AudioStreamPlayer3D.get_stream_playback()` methods. Obtaining the playback instance is only valid after the `stream` property is set as an **AudioStreamPolyphonic** in those players.
