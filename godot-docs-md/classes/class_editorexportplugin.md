# EditorExportPlugin

**Inherits:** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

A script that is executed when exporting the project.

## Description

**EditorExportPlugin**s are automatically invoked whenever the user exports the project. They can be used to modify scenes and resources during project export based on what `Feature Tags ` are set. For each plugin, `_export_begin()` is called at the beginning of the export process and then `_export_file()` is called for each exported file.

Register a **EditorExportPlugin** by creating a new `EditorPlugin` and calling its `EditorPlugin.add_export_plugin()` method.

## Method Descriptions

`bool` **\_begin_customize_resources**(platform: `EditorExportPlatform`, features: `PackedStringArray`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `const`

Return `true` if this plugin will customize resources based on the platform and features used.

When enabled, `_get_customization_configuration_hash()` and `_customize_resource()` will be called and must be implemented.

`bool` **\_begin_customize_scenes**(platform: `EditorExportPlatform`, features: `PackedStringArray`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `const`

Return `true` if this plugin will customize scenes based on the platform and features used.

When enabled, `_get_customization_configuration_hash()` and `_customize_scene()` will be called and must be implemented.

**Note:** `_customize_scene()` will only be called for scenes that have been modified since the last export.

`Resource` **\_customize_resource**(resource: `Resource`, path: `String`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `required (This method is required to be overridden when extending its base class.)`

Customize a resource. If changes are made to it, return the same or a new resource. Otherwise, return `null`. When a new resource is returned, `resource` will be replaced by a copy of the new resource.

The `path` argument is only used when customizing an actual file, otherwise this means that this resource is part of another one and it will be empty.

Implementing this method is required if `_begin_customize_resources()` returns `true`.

**Note:** When customizing any of the following types and returning another resource, the other resource should not be skipped using `skip()` in `_export_file()`:

- `AtlasTexture`
- `CompressedCubemap`
- `CompressedCubemapArray`
- `CompressedTexture2D`
- `CompressedTexture2DArray`
- `CompressedTexture3D`

`Node` **\_customize_scene**(scene: `Node`, path: `String`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `required (This method is required to be overridden when extending its base class.)`

Customize a scene. If changes are made to it, return the same or a new scene. Otherwise, return `null`. If a new scene is returned, it is up to you to dispose of the old one.

Implementing this method is required if `_begin_customize_scenes()` returns `true`.

**Note:** To change a variable in your scene, use the `@export` annotation when declaring it.

`void (No return value.)` **\_end_customize_resources**() `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`

This is called when the customization process for resources ends.

`void (No return value.)` **\_end_customize_scenes**() `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`

This is called when the customization process for scenes ends.

`void (No return value.)` **\_end_generate_apple_embedded_project**(path: `String`, will_build_archive: `bool`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`

This is called after Xcode project generation, but before it is built.

**Note:** Only supported on iOS and visionOS.

`void (No return value.)` **\_export_begin**(features: `PackedStringArray`, is_debug: `bool`, path: `String`, flags: `int`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`

Virtual method to be overridden by the user. It is called when the export starts and provides all information about the export. `features` is the list of features for the export, `is_debug` is `true` for debug builds, `path` is the target path for the exported project. `flags` is only used when running a runnable profile, e.g. when using native run on Android.

`void (No return value.)` **\_export_end**() `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`

Virtual method to be overridden by the user. Called when the export is finished.

`void (No return value.)` **\_export_file**(path: `String`, type: `String`, features: `PackedStringArray`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`

Virtual method to be overridden by the user. Called for each exported file before `_customize_resource()` and `_customize_scene()`. The arguments can be used to identify the file. `path` is the path of the file, `type` is the `Resource` represented by the file (e.g. `PackedScene`), and `features` is the list of features for the export.

Calling `skip()` inside this callback will make the file not included in the export.

`PackedStringArray` **\_get_android_dependencies**(platform: `EditorExportPlatform`, debug: `bool`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `const`

Virtual method to be overridden by the user. This is called to retrieve the set of Android dependencies provided by this plugin. Each returned Android dependency should have the format of an Android remote binary dependency: `org.godot.example:my-plugin:0.0.0`

For more information see [Android documentation on dependencies](https://developer.android.com/build/dependencies?agpversion=4.1#dependency-types).

**Note:** Only supported on Android and requires `EditorExportPlatformAndroid.gradle_build/use_gradle_build` to be enabled.

`PackedStringArray` **\_get_android_dependencies_maven_repos**(platform: `EditorExportPlatform`, debug: `bool`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `const`

Virtual method to be overridden by the user. This is called to retrieve the URLs of Maven repositories for the set of Android dependencies provided by this plugin.

For more information see [Gradle documentation on dependency management](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_management.html#sec:maven_repo).

**Note:** Google's Maven repo and the Maven Central repo are already included by default.

**Note:** Only supported on Android and requires `EditorExportPlatformAndroid.gradle_build/use_gradle_build` to be enabled.

`PackedStringArray` **\_get_android_libraries**(platform: `EditorExportPlatform`, debug: `bool`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `const`

Virtual method to be overridden by the user. This is called to retrieve the local paths of the Android libraries archive (AAR) files provided by this plugin.

**Note:** Relative paths **must** be relative to Godot's `res://addons/` directory. For example, an AAR file located under `res://addons/hello_world_plugin/HelloWorld.release.aar` can be returned as an absolute path using `res://addons/hello_world_plugin/HelloWorld.release.aar` or a relative path using `hello_world_plugin/HelloWorld.release.aar`.

**Note:** Only supported on Android and requires `EditorExportPlatformAndroid.gradle_build/use_gradle_build` to be enabled.

`String` **\_get_android_manifest_activity_element_contents**(platform: `EditorExportPlatform`, debug: `bool`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `const`

Virtual method to be overridden by the user. This is used at export time to update the contents of the `activity` element in the generated Android manifest.

**Note:** Only supported on Android and requires `EditorExportPlatformAndroid.gradle_build/use_gradle_build` to be enabled.

`String` **\_get_android_manifest_application_element_contents**(platform: `EditorExportPlatform`, debug: `bool`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `const`

Virtual method to be overridden by the user. This is used at export time to update the contents of the `application` element in the generated Android manifest.

**Note:** Only supported on Android and requires `EditorExportPlatformAndroid.gradle_build/use_gradle_build` to be enabled.

`String` **\_get_android_manifest_element_contents**(platform: `EditorExportPlatform`, debug: `bool`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `const`

Virtual method to be overridden by the user. This is used at export time to update the contents of the `manifest` element in the generated Android manifest.

**Note:** Only supported on Android and requires `EditorExportPlatformAndroid.gradle_build/use_gradle_build` to be enabled.

`int` **\_get_customization_configuration_hash**() `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `required (This method is required to be overridden when extending its base class.)` `const`

Return a hash based on the configuration passed (for both scenes and resources). This helps keep separate caches for separate export configurations.

Implementing this method is required if `_begin_customize_resources()` returns `true`.

**Note:** `_customize_resource()` and `_customize_scene()` will not be called when the **EditorExportPlugin** script is modified unless this hash changes too.

`PackedStringArray` **\_get_export_features**(platform: `EditorExportPlatform`, debug: `bool`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `const`

Return a `PackedStringArray` of additional features this preset, for the given `platform`, should have.

`bool` **\_get_export_option_visibility**(platform: `EditorExportPlatform`, option: `String`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `const`

Validates `option` and returns the visibility for the specified `platform`. The default implementation returns `true` for all options.

`String` **\_get_export_option_warning**(platform: `EditorExportPlatform`, option: `String`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `const`

Check the requirements for the given `option` and return a non-empty warning string if they are not met.

**Note:** Use `get_option()` to check the value of the export options.

`Array`\[`Dictionary`\] **\_get_export_options**(platform: `EditorExportPlatform`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `const`

Return a list of export options that can be configured for this export plugin.

Each element in the return value is a `Dictionary` with the following keys:

- `option`: A dictionary with the structure documented by `Object.get_property_list()`, but all keys are optional.
- `default_value`: The default value for this option.
- `update_visibility`: An optional boolean value. If set to `true`, the preset will emit `Object.property_list_changed` when the option is changed.

`Dictionary` **\_get_export_options_overrides**(platform: `EditorExportPlatform`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `const`

Return a `Dictionary` of override values for export options, that will be used instead of user-provided values. Overridden options will be hidden from the user interface.

            return "MyExportPlugin"

        func _supports_platform(platform) -> bool:
            if platform is EditorExportPlatformPC:
                # Run on all desktop platforms including Windows, MacOS and Linux.
                return true
            return false

        func _get_export_options_overrides(platform) -> Dictionary:
            # Override "Embed PCK" to always be enabled.
            return {
                "binary_format/embed_pck": true,
            }

`String` **\_get_name**() `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `required (This method is required to be overridden when extending its base class.)` `const`

Return the name identifier of this plugin (for future identification by the exporter). The plugins are sorted by name before exporting.

Implementing this method is required.

`bool` **\_should_update_export_options**(platform: `EditorExportPlatform`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `const`

Return `true` if the result of `_get_export_options()` has changed and the export options of the preset corresponding to `platform` should be updated.

`bool` **\_supports_platform**(platform: `EditorExportPlatform`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `const`

Return `true` if the plugin supports the given `platform`.

`PackedByteArray` **\_update_android_prebuilt_manifest**(platform: `EditorExportPlatform`, manifest_data: `PackedByteArray`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `const`

Provide access to the Android prebuilt manifest and allows the plugin to modify it if needed.

Implementers of this virtual method should take the binary manifest data from `manifest_data`, copy it, modify it, and then return it with the modifications.

If no modifications are needed, then an empty `PackedByteArray` should be returned.

`void (No return value.)` **add_apple_embedded_platform_bundle_file**(path: `String`)

Adds an Apple embedded platform bundle file from the given `path` to the exported project.

`void (No return value.)` **add_apple_embedded_platform_cpp_code**(code: `String`)

`void (No return value.)` **add_apple_embedded_platform_embedded_framework**(path: `String`)

Adds a dynamic library (*.dylib, *.framework) to the Linking Phase in the Apple embedded platform's Xcode project and embeds it into the resulting binary.

**Note:** For static libraries (*.a), this works in the same way as `add_apple_embedded_platform_framework()`.

**Note:** This method should not be used for System libraries as they are already present on the device.

`void (No return value.)` **add_apple_embedded_platform_framework**(path: `String`)

Adds a static library (*.a) or a dynamic library (*.dylib, *.framework) to the Linking Phase to the Apple embedded platform's Xcode project.

Adds a static library from the given `path` to the Apple embedded platform project.

`void (No return value.)` **add_file**(path: `String`, file: `PackedByteArray`, remap: `bool`)

Adds a custom file to be exported. `path` is the virtual path that can be used to load the file, `file` is the binary data of the file.

When called inside `_export_file()` and `remap` is `true`, the current file will not be exported, but instead remapped to this custom file. `remap` is ignored when called in other places.

`file` will not be imported, so consider using `_customize_resource()` to remap imported resources.

`void (No return value.)` **add_ios_bundle_file**(path: `String`)

**Deprecated:** Use `add_apple_embedded_platform_bundle_file()` instead.
