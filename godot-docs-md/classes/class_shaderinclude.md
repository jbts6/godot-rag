# ShaderInclude

**Inherits:** `Resource` **<** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

A snippet of shader code to be included in a `Shader` with `#include`.

## Description

A shader include file, saved with the `.gdshaderinc` extension. This class allows you to define a custom shader snippet that can be included in a `Shader` by using the preprocessor directive `#include`, followed by the file path (e.g. `#include "res://shader_lib.gdshaderinc"`). The snippet doesn't have to be a valid shader on its own.
