# EditorInterface

**Inherits:** `Object`

Godot editor's interface.

## Description

**EditorInterface** gives you control over Godot editor's window. It allows customizing the window, saving and (re-)loading scenes, rendering mesh previews, inspecting and editing resources and objects, and provides access to `EditorSettings`, `EditorFileSystem`, `EditorResourcePreview`, `ScriptEditor`, the editor viewport, and information about scenes.

**Note:** This class shouldn't be instantiated directly. Instead, access the singleton directly by its name.

``` gdscript
var editor_settings = EditorInterface.get_editor_settings()
```

``` csharp
// In C# you can access it via the static Singleton property.
EditorSettings settings = EditorInterface.Singleton.GetEditorSettings();
```

## Property Descriptions

`bool` **distraction_free_mode**

- `void (No return value.)` **set_distraction_free_mode**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **is_distraction_free_mode_enabled**()

If `true`, enables distraction-free mode which hides side docks to increase the space available for the main view.

`bool` **movie_maker_enabled**

- `void (No return value.)` **set_movie_maker_enabled**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **is_movie_maker_enabled**()

If `true`, the Movie Maker mode is enabled in the editor. See `MovieWriter` for more information.

## Method Descriptions

`void (No return value.)` **add_root_node**(node: `Node`)

Makes `node` root of the currently opened scene. Only works if the scene is empty. If the `node` is a scene instance, an inheriting scene will be created.

`Error` **close_scene**()

Closes the currently active scene, discarding any pending changes in the process. Returns `@GlobalScope.OK` on success or `@GlobalScope.ERR_DOES_NOT_EXIST` if there is no scene to close.

`void (No return value.)` **edit_node**(node: `Node`)

Edits the given `Node`. The node will be also selected if it's inside the scene tree.

`void (No return value.)` **edit_resource**(resource: `Resource`)

Edits the given `Resource`. If the resource is a `Script` you can also edit it with `edit_script()` to specify the line and column position.

`void (No return value.)` **edit_script**(script: `Script`, line: `int` = -1, column: `int` = 0, grab_focus: `bool` = true)

Edits the given `Script`. The line and column on which to open the script can also be specified. The script will be open with the user-configured editor for the script's language which may be an external editor.

`Control` **get_base_control**() `const`

Returns the main container of Godot editor's window. For example, you can use it to retrieve the size of the container and place your controls accordingly.

**Warning:** Removing and freeing this node will render the editor useless and may cause a crash.

`EditorCommandPalette` **get_command_palette**() `const`

Returns the editor's `EditorCommandPalette` instance.

**Warning:** Removing and freeing this node will render a part of the editor useless and may cause a crash.

`String` **get_current_directory**() `const`

Returns the current directory being viewed in the `FileSystemDock`. If a file is selected, its base directory will be returned using `String.get_base_dir()` instead.

`String` **get_current_feature_profile**() `const`

Returns the name of the currently activated feature profile. If the default profile is currently active, an empty string is returned instead.

In order to get a reference to the `EditorFeatureProfile`, you must load the feature profile using `EditorFeatureProfile.load_from_file()`.

**Note:** Feature profiles created via the user interface are loaded from the `feature_profiles` directory, as a file with the `.profile` extension. The editor configuration folder can be found by using `EditorPaths.get_config_dir()`.

`String` **get_current_path**() `const`

Returns the current path being viewed in the `FileSystemDock`.

`Node` **get_edited_scene_root**() `const`

Returns the edited (current) scene's root `Node`.

`String` **get_editor_language**() `const`

Returns the language currently used for the editor interface.

`VBoxContainer` **get_editor_main_screen**() `const`

Returns the editor control responsible for main screen plugins and tools. Use it with plugins that implement `EditorPlugin._has_main_screen()`.

**Note:** This node is a `VBoxContainer`, which means that if you add a `Control` child to it, you need to set the child's `Control.size_flags_vertical` to `Control.SIZE_EXPAND_FILL` to make it use the full available space.

**Warning:** Removing and freeing this node will render a part of the editor useless and may cause a crash.

`EditorPaths` **get_editor_paths**() `const`

Returns the `EditorPaths` singleton.

`float` **get_editor_scale**() `const`

Returns the actual scale of the editor UI (`1.0` being 100% scale). This can be used to adjust position and dimensions of the UI added by plugins.

**Note:** This value is set via the `EditorSettings.interface/editor/appearance/display_scale` and `EditorSettings.interface/editor/appearance/custom_display_scale` settings. The editor must be restarted for changes to be properly applied.

`EditorSettings` **get_editor_settings**() `const`

Returns the editor's `EditorSettings` instance.

`Theme` **get_editor_theme**() `const`

Returns the editor's `Theme`.

**Note:** When creating custom editor UI, prefer accessing theme items directly from your GUI nodes using the `get_theme_*` methods.

`EditorToaster` **get_editor_toaster**() `const`

Returns the editor's `EditorToaster`.

`EditorUndoRedoManager` **get_editor_undo_redo**() `const`

Returns the editor's `EditorUndoRedoManager`.

`SubViewport` **get_editor_viewport_2d**() `const`

Returns the 2D editor `SubViewport`. It does not have a camera. Instead, the view transforms are done directly and can be accessed with `Viewport.global_canvas_transform`.

`SubViewport` **get_editor_viewport_3d**(idx: `int` = 0) `const`

Returns the specified 3D editor `SubViewport`, from `0` to `3`. The viewport can be used to access the active editor cameras with `Viewport.get_camera_3d()`.

`FileSystemDock` **get_file_system_dock**() `const`

Returns the editor's `FileSystemDock` instance.

**Warning:** Removing and freeing this node will render a part of the editor useless and may cause a crash.

`EditorInspector` **get_inspector**() `const`

Returns the editor's `EditorInspector` instance.

**Warning:** Removing and freeing this node will render a part of the editor useless and may cause a crash.

`float` **get_node_3d_rotate_snap**() `const`

Returns the amount of degrees the 3D editor's rotational snapping is set to.

`float` **get_node_3d_scale_snap**() `const`

Returns the amount of units the 3D editor's scale snapping is set to.

`float` **get_node_3d_translate_snap**() `const`

Returns the amount of units the 3D editor's translation snapping is set to.

`EditorSelection` **get_selection**() `const`

Returns the editor's `EditorSelection` instance.

`PackedStringArray` **get_unsaved_scenes**() `const`

Returns an array of file paths of currently unsaved scenes.

`void (No return value.)` **inspect_object**(object: `Object`, for_property: `String` = "", inspector_only: `bool` = false)

Shows the given property on the given `object` in the editor's Inspector dock. If `inspector_only` is `true`, plugins will not attempt to edit `object`.

`bool` **is_multi_window_enabled**() `const`

Returns `true` if multiple window support is enabled in the editor. Multiple window support is enabled if *all* of these statements are true:

- `EditorSettings.interface/multi_window/enable` is `true`.
- `EditorSettings.interface/editor/display/single_window_mode` is `false`.
- `Viewport.gui_embed_subwindows` is `false`. This is forced to `true` on platforms that don't support multiple windows such as Web, or when the `--single-window` `command line argument ` is used.

`bool` **is_node_3d_snap_enabled**() `const`

Returns `true` if the 3D editor currently has snapping mode enabled, and `false` otherwise.

`bool` **is_object_edited**(object: `Object`) `const`

Returns `true` if the object has been marked as edited through `set_object_edited()`.

`bool` **is_playing_scene**() `const`

Returns `true` if a scene is currently being played, `false` otherwise. Paused scenes are considered as being played.

`bool` **is_plugin_enabled**(plugin: `String`) `const`

`Array`\[`Texture2D`\] **make_mesh_previews**(meshes: `Array`\[`Mesh`\], preview_size: `int`)

Returns mesh previews rendered at the given size as an `Array` of `Texture2D`s.

`void (No return value.)` **mark_scene_as_unsaved**()

Marks the current scene tab as unsaved.

`void (No return value.)` **open_scene_from_path**(scene_filepath: `String`, set_inherited: `bool` = false)

Opens the scene at the given path. If `set_inherited` is `true`, creates a new inherited scene.

`void (No return value.)` **play_current_scene**()

Plays the currently active scene.

`void (No return value.)` **play_custom_scene**(scene_filepath: `String`)

Plays the scene specified by its filepath.

`void (No return value.)` **play_main_scene**()

Plays the main scene.

`void (No return value.)` **popup_create_dialog**(callback: `Callable`, base_type: `StringName` = "", current_type: `String` = "", dialog_title: `String` = "", type_blocklist: `Array`\[`StringName`\] = \[\])

**Experimental:** This method may be changed or removed in future versions.

Pops up an editor dialog for creating an object.

The `callback` must take a single argument of type `String`, which will contain the type name of the selected object (or the script path of the type, if the type is created from a script), or be an empty string if no item is selected.

The `base_type` specifies the base type of objects to display. For example, if you set this to "Resource", all types derived from `Resource` will display in the create dialog.

The `current_type` will be passed in the search box of the create dialog, and the specified type can be immediately selected when the dialog pops up. If the `current_type` is not derived from `base_type`, there will be no result of the type in the dialog.

The `dialog_title` allows you to define a custom title for the dialog. This is useful if you want to accurately hint the usage of the dialog. If the `dialog_title` is an empty string, the dialog will use "Create New 'Base Type'" as the default title.

The `type_blocklist` contains a list of type names, and the types in the blocklist will be hidden from the create dialog.

**Note:** Trying to list the base type in the `type_blocklist` will hide all types derived from the base type from the create dialog.

`void (No return value.)` **popup_dialog**(dialog: `Window`, rect: `Rect2i` = Rect2i(0, 0, 0, 0))

Pops up the `dialog` in the editor UI with `Window.popup_exclusive()`. The dialog must have no current parent, otherwise the method fails.

See also `Window.set_unparent_when_invisible()`.

`void (No return value.)` **popup_dialog_centered**(dialog: `Window`, minsize: `Vector2i` = Vector2i(0, 0))

Pops up the `dialog` in the editor UI with `Window.popup_exclusive_centered()`. The dialog must have no current parent, otherwise the method fails.

See also `Window.set_unparent_when_invisible()`.

`void (No return value.)` **popup_dialog_centered_clamped**(dialog: `Window`, minsize: `Vector2i` = Vector2i(0, 0), fallback_ratio: `float` = 0.75)

Pops up the `dialog` in the editor UI with `Window.popup_exclusive_centered_clamped()`. The dialog must have no current parent, otherwise the method fails.

See also `Window.set_unparent_when_invisible()`.

`void (No return value.)` **popup_dialog_centered_ratio**(dialog: `Window`, ratio: `float` = 0.8)

Pops up the `dialog` in the editor UI with `Window.popup_exclusive_centered_ratio()`. The dialog must have no current parent, otherwise the method fails.

See also `Window.set_unparent_when_invisible()`.

`void (No return value.)` **popup_method_selector**(object: `Object`, callback: `Callable`, current_value: `String` = "")

Pops up an editor dialog for selecting a method from `object`. The `callback` must take a single argument of type `String` which will contain the name of the selected method or be empty if the dialog is canceled. If `current_value` is provided, the method will be selected automatically in the method list, if it exists.

`void (No return value.)` **popup_node_selector**(callback: `Callable`, valid_types: `Array`\[`StringName`\] = \[\], current_value: `Node` = null)

Pops up an editor dialog for selecting a `Node` from the edited scene. The `callback` must take a single argument of type `NodePath`. It is called on the selected `NodePath` or the empty path `^""` if the dialog is canceled. If `valid_types` is provided, the dialog will only show Nodes that match one of the listed Node types. If `current_value` is provided, the Node will be automatically selected in the tree, if it exists.

**Example:** Display the node selection dialog as soon as this node is added to the tree for the first time:

    func _ready():
        if Engine.is_editor_hint():
            EditorInterface.popup_node_selector(_on_node_selected, ["Button"])

    func _on_node_selected(node_path):
        if node_path.is_empty():
            print("node selection canceled")
        else:
            print("selected ", node_path)

`void (No return value.)` **popup_property_selector**(object: `Object`, callback: `Callable`, type_filter: `PackedInt32Array` = PackedInt32Array(), current_value: `String` = "")

Pops up an editor dialog for selecting properties from `object`. The `callback` must take a single argument of type `NodePath`. It is called on the selected property path (see `NodePath.get_as_property_path()`) or the empty path `^""` if the dialog is canceled. If `type_filter` is provided, the dialog will only show properties that match one of the listed `Variant.Type` values. If `current_value` is provided, the property will be selected automatically in the property list, if it exists.

    func _ready():
        if Engine.is_editor_hint():
            EditorInterface.popup_property_selector(this, _on_property_selected, [TYPE_INT])

    func _on_property_selected(property_path):
        if property_path.is_empty():
            print("property selection canceled")
        else:
            print("selected ", property_path)

`void (No return value.)` **popup_quick_open**(callback: `Callable`, base_types: `Array`\[`StringName`\] = \[\])

Pops up an editor dialog for quick selecting a resource file. The `callback` must take a single argument of type `String` which will contain the path of the selected resource or be empty if the dialog is canceled. If `base_types` is provided, the dialog will only show resources that match these types. Only types deriving from `Resource` are supported.

`void (No return value.)` **reload_scene_from_path**(scene_filepath: `String`)

Reloads the scene at the given path. Fails if the scene is not open.

`void (No return value.)` **restart_editor**(save: `bool` = true)

Restarts the editor. This closes the editor and then opens the same project. If `save` is `true`, the project will be saved before restarting.

`void (No return value.)` **save_all_scenes**()

Saves all opened scenes in the editor.

`Error` **save_scene**()

Saves the currently active scene. Returns either `@GlobalScope.OK` or `@GlobalScope.ERR_CANT_CREATE`.

`void (No return value.)` **save_scene_as**(path: `String`, with_preview: `bool` = true)

Saves the currently active scene as a file at `path`.

`void (No return value.)` **select_file**(file: `String`)

Selects the file, with the path provided by `file`, in the FileSystem dock.

`void (No return value.)` **set_current_feature_profile**(profile_name: `String`)

Selects and activates the specified feature profile with the given `profile_name`. Set `profile_name` to an empty string to reset to the default feature profile.

A feature profile can be created programmatically using the `EditorFeatureProfile` class.

**Note:** The feature profile that gets activated must be located in the `feature_profiles` directory, as a file with the `.profile` extension. If a profile could not be found, an error occurs. The editor configuration folder can be found by using `EditorPaths.get_config_dir()`.

`void (No return value.)` **set_main_screen_editor**(name: `String`)

Sets the editor's current main screen to the one specified in `name`. `name` must match the title of the tab in question exactly (e.g. `2D`, `3D`, `Script`, `Game`, or `Asset Store` for default tabs).

`void (No return value.)` **set_object_edited**(object: `Object`, edited: `bool`)

If `edited` is `true`, the object is marked as edited.

**Note:** This is primarily used by the editor for `Resource` based objects to track their modified state. For example, any changes to an open scene, a resource in the inspector, or an edited script will cause this method to be called with `true`. Saving the scene, script, or resource resets the edited state by calling this method with `false`.

**Note:** Each call to this method increments the object's edited version. This is used to track changes in the editor and to trigger when thumbnails should be regenerated for resources.

`void (No return value.)` **set_plugin_enabled**(plugin: `String`, enabled: `bool`)

Sets the enabled status of a plugin. The plugin name is the same as its directory name.

`void (No return value.)` **stop_playing_scene**()

Stops the scene that is currently playing.
