# OpenXRCompositionLayer

**Experimental:** This class may be changed or removed in future versions.

**Inherits:** `Node3D` **<** `Node` **<** `Object`

**Inherited By:** `OpenXRCompositionLayerCylinder`, `OpenXRCompositionLayerEquirect`, `OpenXRCompositionLayerQuad`

The parent class of all OpenXR composition layer nodes.

## Description

Composition layers allow 2D viewports to be displayed inside of the headset by the XR compositor through special projections that retain their quality. This allows for rendering clear text while keeping the layer at a native resolution.

**Note:** If the OpenXR runtime doesn't support the given composition layer type, a fallback mesh can be generated with a `ViewportTexture`, in order to emulate the composition layer.

## Enumerations

enum **Filter**:

`Filter` **FILTER_NEAREST** = `0`

Perform nearest-neighbor filtering when sampling the texture.

`Filter` **FILTER_LINEAR** = `1`

Perform linear filtering when sampling the texture.

`Filter` **FILTER_CUBIC** = `2`

Perform cubic filtering when sampling the texture.

enum **MipmapMode**:

`MipmapMode` **MIPMAP_MODE_DISABLED** = `0`

Disable mipmapping.

**Note:** Mipmapping can only be disabled in the Compatibility renderer.

`MipmapMode` **MIPMAP_MODE_NEAREST** = `1`

Use the mipmap of the nearest resolution.

Use linear interpolation of the two mipmaps of the nearest resolution.

`Wrap` **WRAP_MIRRORED_REPEAT** = `3`

Repeat the texture infinitely, mirroring it on each repeat.

`Wrap` **WRAP_MIRROR_CLAMP_TO_EDGE** = `4`

**Note:** This wrap mode is not available in the Compatibility renderer.

## Property Descriptions

`bool` **alpha_blend** = `false`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_alpha_blend**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **get_alpha_blend**()

Enables the blending the layer using its alpha channel.

Can be combined with `Viewport.transparent_bg` to give the layer a transparent background.

`Vector2i` **android_surface_size** = `Vector2i(1024, 1024)`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_android_surface_size**(value: `Vector2i`)
- `Vector2i` **get_android_surface_size**()

The size of the Android surface to create if `use_android_surface` is enabled.

`bool` **enable_hole_punch** = `false`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_enable_hole_punch**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **get_enable_hole_punch**()

Enables a technique called "hole punching", which allows putting the composition layer behind the main projection layer (i.e. setting `sort_order` to a negative value) while "punching a hole" through everything rendered by Godot so that the layer is still visible.

This can be used to create the illusion that the composition layer exists in the same 3D space as everything rendered by Godot, allowing objects to appear to pass both behind or in front of the composition layer.

`EyeVisibility` **eye_visibility** = `0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_eye_visibility**(value: `EyeVisibility`)
- `EyeVisibility` **get_eye_visibility**()

- `void (No return value.)` **set_sort_order**(value: `int`)
- `int` **get_sort_order**()

The sort order for this composition layer. Higher numbers will be shown in front of lower numbers.

- `bool` **get_use_android_surface**()

If enabled, an Android surface will be created (with the dimensions from `android_surface_size`) which will provide the 2D content for the composition layer, rather than using `layer_viewport`.

See `get_android_surface()` for information about how to get the surface so that your application can draw to it.

**Note:** This will only work in Android builds.

## Method Descriptions

`JavaObject` **get_android_surface**()

Returns a `JavaObject` representing an `android.view.Surface` if `use_android_surface` is enabled and OpenXR has created the surface. Otherwise, this will return `null`.

**Note:** The surface can only be created during an active OpenXR session. So, if `use_android_surface` is enabled outside of an OpenXR session, it won't be created until a new session fully starts.

`Vector2` **intersects_ray**(origin: `Vector3`, direction: `Vector3`) `const`

Returns UV coordinates where the given ray intersects with the composition layer. `origin` and `direction` must be in global space.

Returns `Vector2(-1.0, -1.0)` if the ray doesn't intersect.

`bool` **is_natively_supported**() `const`

Returns `true` if the OpenXR runtime natively supports this composition layer type.

**Note:** This will only return an accurate result after the OpenXR session has started.
