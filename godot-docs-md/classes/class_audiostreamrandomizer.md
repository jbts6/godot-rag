# AudioStreamRandomizer

**Inherits:** `AudioStream` **<** `Resource` **<** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

Wraps a pool of audio streams with pitch and volume shifting.

## Description

Picks a random AudioStream from the pool, depending on the playback mode, and applies random pitch shifting and volume shifting during playback.

## Tutorials

- `Audio streams `

## Enumerations

enum **PlaybackMode**:

`PlaybackMode` **PLAYBACK_RANDOM_NO_REPEATS** = `0`

Pick a stream at random according to the probability weights chosen for each stream, but avoid playing the same stream twice in a row whenever possible. If only 1 sound is present in the pool, the same sound will always play, effectively allowing repeats to occur.

`PlaybackMode` **PLAYBACK_RANDOM** = `1`

Pick a stream at random according to the probability weights chosen for each stream. If only 1 sound is present in the pool, the same sound will always play.

`PlaybackMode` **PLAYBACK_SEQUENTIAL** = `2`

Play streams in the order they appear in the stream pool. If only 1 sound is present in the pool, the same sound will always play.

## Property Descriptions

`PlaybackMode` **playback_mode** = `0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_playback_mode**(value: `PlaybackMode`)
- `PlaybackMode` **get_playback_mode**()

Controls how this AudioStreamRandomizer picks which AudioStream to play next.

`float` **random_pitch** = `1.0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_random_pitch**(value: `float`)
- `float` **get_random_pitch**()

The largest possible frequency multiplier of the random pitch variation. Pitch will be randomly chosen within a range of `1.0 / random_pitch` and `random_pitch`. A value of `1.0` means no variation. A value of `2.0` means pitch will be randomized between double and half.

**Note:** Setting this property also sets `random_pitch_semitones`.

`float` **random_pitch_semitones** = `0.0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_random_pitch_semitones**(value: `float`)
- `float` **get_random_pitch_semitones**()

The largest possible distance, in semitones, of the random pitch variation. A value of `0.0` means no variation.

**Note:** Setting this property also sets `random_pitch`.

`float` **random_volume_offset_db** = `0.0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_random_volume_offset_db**(value: `float`)
- `float` **get_random_volume_offset_db**()

The intensity of random volume variation. Volume will be increased or decreased by a random value up to `random_volume_offset_db`. A value of `0.0` means no variation. A value of `3.0` means volume will be randomized between `-3.0 dB` and `+3.0 dB`.

`AudioStream` **stream\_{index}/stream**

The `AudioStream` at `index`.

**Note:** `index` is a value in the `0 .. streams_count - 1` range.

`float` **stream\_{index}/weight** = `1.0`

The probability weight of the `AudioStream` at `index`.

**Note:** `index` is a value in the `0 .. streams_count - 1` range.

`int` **streams_count** = `0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_streams_count**(value: `int`)
- `int` **get_streams_count**()

The number of streams in the stream pool.

## Method Descriptions

`void (No return value.)` **add_stream**(index: `int`, stream: `AudioStream`, weight: `float` = 1.0)

Insert a stream at the specified index. If the index is less than zero, the insertion occurs at the end of the underlying pool.

`AudioStream` **get_stream**(index: `int`) `const`

Returns the stream at the specified index.

`float` **get_stream_probability_weight**(index: `int`) `const`

Returns the probability weight associated with the stream at the given index.

`void (No return value.)` **move_stream**(index_from: `int`, index_to: `int`)

Move a stream from one index to another.

`void (No return value.)` **remove_stream**(index: `int`)

Remove the stream at the specified index.

`void (No return value.)` **set_stream**(index: `int`, stream: `AudioStream`)

Set the AudioStream at the specified index.

`void (No return value.)` **set_stream_probability_weight**(index: `int`, weight: `float`)

Set the probability weight of the stream at the specified index. The higher this value, the more likely that the randomizer will choose this stream during random playback modes.
