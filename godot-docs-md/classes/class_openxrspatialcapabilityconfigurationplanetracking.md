Configuration header for plane tracking.

## Description

Configuration header for plane tracking. Pass this to `OpenXRSpatialEntityExtension.create_spatial_context()` to create a spatial context with plane tracking capabilities.

## Method Descriptions

`PackedInt64Array` **get_enabled_components**() `const`

Returns the components enabled by this configuration.

**Note:** Only valid after this configuration was used to create a spatial context.

`bool` **supports_labels**()

Returns `true` if we support the plane semantic label component (only valid after the OpenXR session has started). You can query these using the `OpenXRSpatialComponentPlaneSemanticLabelList` data object.

`bool` **supports_mesh_2d**()

Returns `true` if we support the mesh 2D component (only valid after the OpenXR session has started). You can query these using the `OpenXRSpatialComponentMesh2DList` data object.

`bool` **supports_polygons**()

Returns `true` if we support the polygon 2D component (only valid after the OpenXR session has started). You can query these using the `OpenXRSpatialComponentPolygon2DList` data object.
