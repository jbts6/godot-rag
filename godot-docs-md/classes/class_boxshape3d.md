# BoxShape3D

**Inherits:** `Shape3D` **<** `Resource` **<** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

A 3D box shape used for physics collision.

## Description

A 3D box shape, intended for use in physics. Usually used to provide a shape for a `CollisionShape3D`.

**Performance:** **BoxShape3D** is fast to check collisions against. It is faster than `CapsuleShape3D` and `CylinderShape3D`, but slower than `SphereShape3D`.
