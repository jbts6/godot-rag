# SubViewportContainer

**Inherits:** `Container` **<** `Control` **<** `CanvasItem` **<** `Node` **<** `Object`

A container used for displaying the contents of a `SubViewport`.

## Description

A container that displays the contents of underlying `SubViewport` child nodes. It uses the combined size of the `SubViewport`s as minimum size, unless `stretch` is enabled.

**Note:** Changing a **SubViewportContainer**'s `Control.scale` will cause its contents to appear distorted. To change its visual size without causing distortion, adjust the node's margins instead (if it's not already in a container).

**Note:** The **SubViewportContainer** forwards mouse-enter and mouse-exit notifications to its sub-viewports.

## Property Descriptions

`bool` **mouse_target** = `false`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_mouse_target**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **is_mouse_target_enabled**()

Configure, if either the **SubViewportContainer** or alternatively the `Control` nodes of its `SubViewport` children should be available as targets of mouse-related functionalities, like identifying the drop target in drag-and-drop operations or cursor shape of hovered `Control` node.

If `false`, the `Control` nodes inside its `SubViewport` children are considered as targets.

If `true`, the **SubViewportContainer** itself will be considered as a target.

`bool` **stretch** = `false`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_stretch**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **is_stretch_enabled**()

If `true`, the sub-viewport will be automatically resized to the control's size.

**Note:** If `true`, this will prohibit changing `SubViewport.size` of its children manually.

`int` **stretch_shrink** = `1`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_stretch_shrink**(value: `int`)
- `int` **get_stretch_shrink**()

Divides the sub-viewport's effective resolution by this value while preserving its scale. This can be used to speed up rendering.

For example, a 1280×720 sub-viewport with `stretch_shrink` set to `2` will be rendered at 640×360 while occupying the same size in the container.

**Note:** `stretch` must be `true` for this property to work.

## Method Descriptions

`bool` **\_propagate_input_event**(event: `InputEvent`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `const`

**Experimental:** This method may be changed or removed in future versions.

Virtual method to be implemented by the user. If it returns `true`, the `event` is propagated to `SubViewport` children. Propagation doesn't happen if it returns `false`. If the function is not implemented, all events are propagated to SubViewports.
