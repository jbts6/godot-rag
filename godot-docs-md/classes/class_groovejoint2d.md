# GrooveJoint2D

**Inherits:** `Joint2D` **<** `Node2D` **<** `CanvasItem` **<** `Node` **<** `Object`

A physics joint that restricts the movement of two 2D physics bodies to a fixed axis.

## Description

A physics joint that restricts the movement of two 2D physics bodies to a fixed axis. For example, a `StaticBody2D` representing a piston base can be attached to a `RigidBody2D` representing the piston head, moving up and down.

## Property Descriptions

`float` **initial_offset** = `25.0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_initial_offset**(value: `float`)
- `float` **get_initial_offset**()

The body B's initial anchor position defined by the joint's origin and a local offset `initial_offset` along the joint's Y axis (along the groove).

`float` **length** = `50.0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_length**(value: `float`)
- `float` **get_length**()

The groove's length. The groove is from the joint's origin towards `length` along the joint's local Y axis.
