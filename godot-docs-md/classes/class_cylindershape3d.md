# CylinderShape3D

**Inherits:** `Shape3D` **<** `Resource` **<** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

A 3D cylinder shape used for physics collision.

## Description

A 3D cylinder shape, intended for use in physics. Usually used to provide a shape for a `CollisionShape3D`.

**Note:** There are several known bugs with cylinder collision shapes. Using `CapsuleShape3D` or `BoxShape3D` instead is recommended.

**Performance:** **CylinderShape3D** is fast to check collisions against, but it is slower than `CapsuleShape3D`, `BoxShape3D`, and `SphereShape3D`.
