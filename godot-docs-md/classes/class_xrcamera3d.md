# XRCamera3D

**Inherits:** `Camera3D` **<** `Node3D` **<** `Node` **<** `Object`

A camera node which automatically positions itself based on XR tracking data.

## Description

A camera node which automatically positions itself based on XR tracking data.

In contrast to `XRController3D`, the render thread has access to more up-to-date tracking data, and the location of the **XRCamera3D** node can lag a few milliseconds behind what is used for rendering.

**Note:** If `Viewport.use_xr` is `true`, most of the camera properties are overridden by the active `XRInterface`. The only properties that can be trusted are the near and far planes.
