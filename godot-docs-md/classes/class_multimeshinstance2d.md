# MultiMeshInstance2D

**Inherits:** `Node2D` **<** `CanvasItem` **<** `Node` **<** `Object`

Node that instances a `MultiMesh` in 2D.

## Description

**MultiMeshInstance2D** is a specialized node to instance a `MultiMesh` resource in 2D. This can be faster to render compared to displaying many `Sprite2D` nodes with large transparent areas, especially if the nodes take up a lot of space on screen at high viewport resolutions. This is because using a mesh designed to fit the sprites' opaque areas will reduce GPU fill rate utilization (at the cost of increased vertex processing utilization).

Usage is the same as `MultiMeshInstance3D`.

## Signals

**texture_changed**()

Emitted when the `texture` is changed.

## Property Descriptions

`MultiMesh` **multimesh**

- `void (No return value.)` **set_multimesh**(value: `MultiMesh`)
- `MultiMesh` **get_multimesh**()

The `MultiMesh` that will be drawn by the **MultiMeshInstance2D**.

`Texture2D` **texture**

- `void (No return value.)` **set_texture**(value: `Texture2D`)
- `Texture2D` **get_texture**()

The `Texture2D` that will be used if using the default `CanvasItemMaterial`. Can be accessed as `TEXTURE` in CanvasItem shader.
