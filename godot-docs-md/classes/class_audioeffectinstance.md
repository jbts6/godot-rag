# AudioEffectInstance

**Inherits:** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

**Inherited By:** `AudioEffectSpectrumAnalyzerInstance`

Manipulates the audio it receives for a given effect.

## Description

An audio effect instance manipulates the audio it receives for a given effect. This instance is automatically created by an `AudioEffect` when it is added to a bus, and should usually not be created directly. If necessary, it can be fetched at run-time with `AudioServer.get_bus_effect_instance()`.

## Method Descriptions

`void (No return value.)` **\_process**(src_buffer: `const void*`, r_dst_buffer: `AudioFrame*`, frame_count: `int`) `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `required (This method is required to be overridden when extending its base class.)`

Called by the `AudioServer` to process this effect. When `_process_silence()` is not overridden or it returns `false`, this method is called only when the bus is active.

**Note:** It is not useful to override this method in GDScript or C#. Only GDExtension can take advantage of it.

`bool` **\_process_silence**() `virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)` `const`

Override this method to customize the processing behavior of this effect instance.

Should return `true` to force the `AudioServer` to always call `_process()`, even if the bus has been muted or cannot otherwise be heard.
