# EditorResourcePreview

**Inherits:** `Node` **<** `Object`

A node used to generate previews of resources or files.

## Description

This node is used to generate previews for resources or files.

**Note:** This class shouldn't be instantiated directly. Instead, access the singleton using `EditorInterface.get_resource_previewer()`.

## Signals

**preview_invalidated**(path: `String`)

Emitted if a preview was invalidated (changed). `path` corresponds to the path of the preview.

## Method Descriptions

`void (No return value.)` **add_preview_generator**(generator: `EditorResourcePreviewGenerator`)

Create an own, custom preview generator.

`void (No return value.)` **check_for_invalidation**(path: `String`)

Check if the resource changed, if so, it will be invalidated and the corresponding signal emitted.

`void (No return value.)` **queue_edited_resource_preview**(resource: `Resource`, receiver: `Object`, receiver_func: `StringName`, userdata: `Variant`)

Queue the `resource` being edited for preview. Once the preview is ready, the `receiver`'s `receiver_func` will be called. The `receiver_func` must take the following four arguments: `String` path, `Texture2D` preview, `Texture2D` thumbnail_preview, `Variant` userdata. `userdata` can be anything, and will be returned when `receiver_func` is called.

**Note:** If it was not possible to create the preview the `receiver_func` will still be called, but the preview will be `null`.

`void (No return value.)` **queue_resource_preview**(path: `String`, receiver: `Object`, receiver_func: `StringName`, userdata: `Variant`)

Queue a resource file located at `path` for preview. Once the preview is ready, the `receiver`'s `receiver_func` will be called. The `receiver_func` must take the following four arguments: `String` path, `Texture2D` preview, `Texture2D` thumbnail_preview, `Variant` userdata. `userdata` can be anything, and will be returned when `receiver_func` is called.

**Note:** If it was not possible to create the preview the `receiver_func` will still be called, but the preview will be `null`.

`void (No return value.)` **remove_preview_generator**(generator: `EditorResourcePreviewGenerator`)

Removes a custom preview generator.
