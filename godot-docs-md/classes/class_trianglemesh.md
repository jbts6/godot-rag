# TriangleMesh

**Inherits:** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

Triangle geometry for efficient, physicsless intersection queries.

## Description

Creates a bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) tree structure around triangle geometry.

The triangle BVH tree can be used for efficient intersection queries without involving a physics engine.

For example, this can be used in editor tools to select objects with complex shapes based on the mouse cursor position.

**Performance:** Creating the BVH tree for complex geometry is a slow process and best done in a background thread.

## Method Descriptions

`bool` **create_from_faces**(faces: `PackedVector3Array`)

Creates the BVH tree from an array of faces. Each 3 vertices of the input `faces` array represent one triangle (face).

Returns `true` if the tree is successfully built, `false` otherwise.

`PackedVector3Array` **get_faces**() `const`

Returns a copy of the geometry faces. Each 3 vertices of the array represent one triangle (face).

`Dictionary` **intersect_ray**(begin: `Vector3`, dir: `Vector3`) `const`

Tests for intersection with a ray starting at `begin` and facing `dir` and extending toward infinity.

If an intersection with a triangle happens, returns a `Dictionary` with the following fields:

`position`: The position on the intersected triangle.

`normal`: The normal of the intersected triangle.

`face_index`: The index of the intersected triangle.

Returns an empty `Dictionary` if no intersection happens.

See also `intersect_segment()`, which is similar but uses a finite-length segment.

`Dictionary` **intersect_segment**(begin: `Vector3`, end: `Vector3`) `const`

Tests for intersection with a segment going from `begin` to `end`.

If an intersection with a triangle happens returns a `Dictionary` with the following fields:

`position`: The position on the intersected triangle.

`normal`: The normal of the intersected triangle.

`face_index`: The index of the intersected triangle.

Returns an empty `Dictionary` if no intersection happens.

See also `intersect_ray()`, which is similar but uses an infinite-length ray.
