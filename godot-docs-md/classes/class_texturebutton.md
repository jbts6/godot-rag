# TextureButton

**Inherits:** `BaseButton` **<** `Control` **<** `CanvasItem` **<** `Node` **<** `Object`

Texture-based button. Supports Pressed, Hover, Disabled and Focused states.

## Description

**TextureButton** has the same functionality as `Button`, except it uses sprites instead of Godot's `Theme` resource. It is faster to create, but it doesn't support localization like more complex `Control`s.

See also `BaseButton` which contains common properties and methods associated with this node.

**Note:** Setting a texture for the "normal" state (`texture_normal`) is recommended. If `texture_normal` is not set, the **TextureButton** will still receive input events and be clickable, but the user will not be able to see it unless they activate another one of its states with a texture assigned (e.g., hover over it to show `texture_hover`).

## Enumerations

enum **StretchMode**:

`StretchMode` **STRETCH_SCALE** = `0`

Scale to fit the node's bounding rectangle.

`StretchMode` **STRETCH_TILE** = `1`

Tile inside the node's bounding rectangle.

`StretchMode` **STRETCH_KEEP** = `2`

The texture keeps its original size and stays in the bounding rectangle's top-left corner.

`StretchMode` **STRETCH_KEEP_CENTERED** = `3`

The texture keeps its original size and stays centered in the node's bounding rectangle.

`StretchMode` **STRETCH_KEEP_ASPECT** = `4`

Scale the texture to fit the node's bounding rectangle, but maintain the texture's aspect ratio.

`StretchMode` **STRETCH_KEEP_ASPECT_CENTERED** = `5`

Scale the texture to fit the node's bounding rectangle, center it, and maintain its aspect ratio.

`StretchMode` **STRETCH_KEEP_ASPECT_COVERED** = `6`

Scale the texture so that the shorter side fits the bounding rectangle. The other side clips to the node's limits.

## Property Descriptions

`bool` **flip_h** = `false`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_flip_h**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **is_flipped_h**()

If `true`, texture is flipped horizontally.

`bool` **flip_v** = `false`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_flip_v**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **is_flipped_v**()

If `true`, texture is flipped vertically.

`bool` **ignore_texture_size** = `false`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_ignore_texture_size**(value: `bool`)
- `bool` **get_ignore_texture_size**()

If `true`, the size of the texture won't be considered for minimum size calculation, so the **TextureButton** can be shrunk down past the texture size.

`StretchMode` **stretch_mode** = `2`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_stretch_mode**(value: `StretchMode`)
- `StretchMode` **get_stretch_mode**()

Controls the texture's behavior when you resize the node's bounding rectangle. See the `StretchMode` constants for available options.

`BitMap` **texture_click_mask**

- `void (No return value.)` **set_click_mask**(value: `BitMap`)
- `BitMap` **get_click_mask**()

Pure black and white `BitMap` image to use for click detection. On the mask, white pixels represent the button's clickable area. Use it to create buttons with curved shapes.

`Texture2D` **texture_disabled**

- `void (No return value.)` **set_texture_disabled**(value: `Texture2D`)
- `Texture2D` **get_texture_disabled**()

Texture to display when the node is disabled. See `BaseButton.disabled`. If not assigned, the **TextureButton** displays `texture_normal` instead.

`Texture2D` **texture_focused**

- `void (No return value.)` **set_texture_focused**(value: `Texture2D`)
- `Texture2D` **get_texture_focused**()

Texture to *overlay on the base texture* when the node has mouse or keyboard focus. Because `texture_focused` is displayed on top of the base texture, a partially transparent texture should be used to ensure the base texture remains visible. A texture that represents an outline or an underline works well for this purpose. To disable the focus visual effect, assign a fully transparent texture of any size. Note that disabling the focus visual effect will harm keyboard/controller navigation usability, so this is not recommended for accessibility reasons.

`Texture2D` **texture_hover**

- `void (No return value.)` **set_texture_hover**(value: `Texture2D`)
- `Texture2D` **get_texture_hover**()

Texture to display when the mouse hovers over the node. If not assigned, the **TextureButton** displays `texture_normal` instead when hovered over.

`Texture2D` **texture_normal**

- `void (No return value.)` **set_texture_normal**(value: `Texture2D`)
- `Texture2D` **get_texture_normal**()

Texture to display by default, when the node is **not** in the disabled, hover or pressed state. This texture is still displayed in the focused state, with `texture_focused` drawn on top.

`Texture2D` **texture_pressed**

- `void (No return value.)` **set_texture_pressed**(value: `Texture2D`)
- `Texture2D` **get_texture_pressed**()

Texture to display on mouse down over the node, if the node has keyboard focus and the player presses the Enter key or if the player presses the `BaseButton.shortcut` key. If not assigned, the **TextureButton** displays `texture_hover` instead when pressed.
