# AudioEffectPitchShift

**Inherits:** `AudioEffect` **<** `Resource` **<** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

Adds a pitch-shifting audio effect to an audio bus.

Raises or lowers the pitch of the input audio.

## Description

Allows modulation of pitch without modifying speed. All frequencies can be raised or lowered with minimal effect on transients.

## Enumerations

enum **FFTSize**:

`FFTSize` **FFT_SIZE_256** = `0`

Use a buffer of 256 samples for the Fast Fourier transform. Lowest latency, but least stable over time.

`FFTSize` **FFT_SIZE_512** = `1`

Use a buffer of 512 samples for the Fast Fourier transform. Low latency, but less stable over time.

`FFTSize` **FFT_SIZE_1024** = `2`

Use a buffer of 1024 samples for the Fast Fourier transform. This is a compromise between latency and stability over time.

`FFTSize` **FFT_SIZE_2048** = `3`

Use a buffer of 2048 samples for the Fast Fourier transform. High latency, but stable over time.

`FFTSize` **FFT_SIZE_4096** = `4`

Use a buffer of 4096 samples for the Fast Fourier transform. Highest latency, but most stable over time.

`FFTSize` **FFT_SIZE_MAX** = `5`

Represents the size of the `FFTSize` enum.

## Property Descriptions

`FFTSize` **fft_size** = `3`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_fft_size**(value: `FFTSize`)
- `FFTSize` **get_fft_size**()

The size of the [Fast Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) buffer. Higher values smooth out the effect over time, but have greater latency. The effects of this higher latency are especially noticeable on audio signals that have sudden amplitude changes.

`int` **oversampling** = `4`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_oversampling**(value: `int`)
- `int` **get_oversampling**()

The oversampling factor to use. Higher values result in better quality, but are more demanding on the CPU and may cause audio cracking if the CPU can't keep up.

`float` **pitch_scale** = `1.0`

- `void (No return value.)` **set_pitch_scale**(value: `float`)
- `float` **get_pitch_scale**()

The pitch scale to use. `1.0` is the default pitch and plays sounds unaffected. `pitch_scale` can range from 0 (infinitely low pitch, inaudible) to 16 (16 times higher than the initial pitch).
