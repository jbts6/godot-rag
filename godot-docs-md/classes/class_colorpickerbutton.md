# ColorPickerButton

**Inherits:** `Button` **<** `BaseButton` **<** `Control` **<** `CanvasItem` **<** `Node` **<** `Object`

A button that brings up a `ColorPicker` when pressed.

## Description

Encapsulates a `ColorPicker`, making it accessible by pressing a button. Pressing the button will toggle the `ColorPicker`'s visibility.

See also `BaseButton` which contains common properties and methods associated with this node.

**Note:** By default, the button may not be wide enough for the color preview swatch to be visible. Make sure to set `Control.custom_minimum_size` to a big enough value to give the button enough space.
