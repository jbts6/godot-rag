# ResourceUID

**Inherits:** `Object`

A singleton that manages the unique identifiers of all resources within a project.

## Description

Resource UIDs (Unique IDentifiers) allow the engine to keep references between resources intact, even if files are renamed or moved. They can be accessed with `uid://`.

**ResourceUID** keeps track of all registered resource UIDs in a project, generates new UIDs, and converts between their string and integer representations.

## Constants

**INVALID_ID** = `-1`

The value to use for an invalid UID, for example if the resource could not be loaded.

Its text representation is `uid://`.

## Method Descriptions

`void (No return value.)` **add_id**(id: `int`, path: `String`)

Adds a new UID value which is mapped to the given resource path.

Fails with an error if the UID already exists, so be sure to check `has_id()` beforehand, or use `set_id()` instead.

`int` **create_id**()

Generates a random resource UID which is guaranteed to be unique within the list of currently loaded UIDs.

In order for this UID to be registered, you must call `add_id()` or `set_id()`.

`int` **create_id_for_path**(path: `String`)

Like `create_id()`, but the UID is seeded with the provided `path` and project name. UIDs generated for that path will be always the same within the current project.

`String` **ensure_path**(path_or_uid: `String`) `static (This method doesn't need an instance to be called, so it can be called directly using the class name.)`

Returns a path, converting `path_or_uid` if necessary. Fails and returns an empty string if an invalid UID is provided.

`String` **get_id_path**(id: `int`) `const`

Returns the path that the given UID value refers to.

Fails with an error if the UID does not exist, so be sure to check `has_id()` beforehand.

`bool` **has_id**(id: `int`) `const`

Returns whether the given UID value is known to the cache.

`String` **id_to_text**(id: `int`) `const`

Converts the given UID to a `uid://` string value.

`String` **path_to_uid**(path: `String`) `static (This method doesn't need an instance to be called, so it can be called directly using the class name.)`

Converts the provided resource `path` to a UID. Returns the unchanged path if it has no associated UID.

`void (No return value.)` **remove_id**(id: `int`)

Removes a loaded UID value from the cache.

Fails with an error if the UID does not exist, so be sure to check `has_id()` beforehand.

`void (No return value.)` **set_id**(id: `int`, path: `String`)

Updates the resource path of an existing UID.

Fails with an error if the UID does not exist, so be sure to check `has_id()` beforehand, or use `add_id()` instead.

`int` **text_to_id**(text_id: `String`) `const`

Extracts the UID value from the given `uid://` string.

`String` **uid_to_path**(uid: `String`) `static (This method doesn't need an instance to be called, so it can be called directly using the class name.)`

Converts the provided `uid` to a path. Prints an error if the UID is invalid.
