# OpenXRInterface

**Inherits:** `XRInterface` **<** `RefCounted` **<** `Object`

Our OpenXR interface.

## Description

The OpenXR interface allows Godot to interact with OpenXR runtimes and make it possible to create XR experiences and games.

Due to the needs of OpenXR this interface works slightly different than other plugin based XR interfaces. It needs to be initialized when Godot starts. You need to enable OpenXR, settings for this can be found in your games project settings under the XR heading. You do need to mark a viewport for use with XR in order for Godot to know which render result should be output to the headset.

## Signals

**cpu_level_changed**(sub_domain: `int`, from_level: `int`, to_level: `int`)

Informs the device CPU performance level has changed in the specified subdomain.

**gpu_level_changed**(sub_domain: `int`, from_level: `int`, to_level: `int`)

Informs the device GPU performance level has changed in the specified subdomain.

**instance_exiting**()

Informs our OpenXR instance is exiting.

**pose_recentered**()

Informs the user queued a recenter of the player position.

**refresh_rate_changed**(refresh_rate: `float`)

Informs the user the HMD refresh rate has changed.

**Note:** Only emitted if XR runtime supports the refresh rate extension.

**session_begun**()

Informs our OpenXR session has been started.

**session_focussed**()

Informs our OpenXR session now has focus, for example output is sent to the HMD and we're receiving XR input.

Informs our OpenXR session is in the process of being lost.

**session_stopping**()

Informs our OpenXR session is stopping.
